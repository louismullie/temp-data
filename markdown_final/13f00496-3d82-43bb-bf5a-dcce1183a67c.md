## Question

Can reticulocyte index be low in severe iron-deficiency anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the reticulocyte production index (RPI) can be low in severe iron-deficiency anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the RPI measures and why it is used. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of iron-deficiency anemia and how it affects erythropoiesis. Next, I will examine whether the marrow response in iron deficiency is appropriately increased or inappropriately low for the degree of anemia. After that, I should review direct evidence linking iron deficiency to low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte counts. Finally, I will synthesize the answer and consider any exceptions or confounders that could alter interpretation of the RPI in this setting.

> Let me first confirm the construct of the reticulocyte production index. The RPI corrects the relative reticulocyte count for the severity of anemia and for reticulocyte maturation time, thereby estimating effective marrow output. A value less than 2 in the setting of anemia suggests an inadequate erythropoietic response, whereas values above 2 suggest an appropriate hyperproliferative response, so I need to ensure I interpret any reticulocyte count in that context [^1162sf16] [^1171wSFX].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology of iron-deficiency anemia. Severe iron deficiency constrains heme synthesis, impairs erythroid proliferation and differentiation, and ultimately reduces effective red cell production despite erythropoietin stimulation; clinically, this manifests as microcytic, hypochromic anemia with low ferritin and low transferrin saturation, and importantly, the marrow's attempt to compensate is throttled by the lack of iron, which should suppress reticulocyte output relative to the degree of anemia [^111Y5frp] [^116Ln8KB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify whether the marrow response in iron deficiency is appropriately increased or inappropriately low. Multiple clinical sources explicitly note that in iron deficiency the reticulocyte count is reduced or "normal", but it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia; this mismatch is precisely what makes the reticulocyte response "inappropriate" for the degree of anemia, and by extension, it lowers the RPI into a suboptimal range despite the severity of hemoglobin decline [^111Y5frp] [^116116vp].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic basis for a low RPI in severe iron deficiency. The reticulocyte production index is a function of the reticulocyte percentage, the patient's hematocrit relative to normal, and the maturation time; when iron is lacking, erythroid precursors cannot complete hemoglobinization and are either destroyed in the marrow or released as hypochromic reticulocytes in insufficient numbers, so the numerator (effective reticulocytes) fails to rise adequately as the denominator (anemia severity) increases, yielding a low RPI despite erythropoietin drive [^1162sf16] [^111Y5frp].

> I should double-check for direct evidence. Clinical reviews and practice-oriented guidance consistently describe iron deficiency as a cause of anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes, and they emphasize using the reticulocyte count and RPI to distinguish decreased production from increased destruction. This pattern is a hallmark of hypoproliferative anemias, of which iron deficiency is a prime example, reinforcing that the RPI is characteristically low or inappropriately normal in severe iron-deficiency anemia [^116116vp] [^111Y5frp].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions that could mask this pattern? I need to ensure I consider confounders: concurrent inflammation or anemia of chronic disease can further blunt erythropoiesis, recent bleeding can transiently elevate reticulocytes, and nutritional cofactor deficiencies or marrow disorders could independently suppress reticulocytes. However, in isolated, untreated severe iron-deficiency anemia, the expected pattern remains a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count and RPI, reflecting iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^117St36s] [^111Y5frp].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, the reticulocyte production index can be low in severe iron-deficiency anemia. In fact, it is expected to be low or inappropriately normal because the marrow cannot mount an adequate reticulocyte response due to iron lack, and this discordance between anemia severity and reticulocyte output is a key diagnostic clue to iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^111Y5frp] [^116116vp].

---

The reticulocyte index is typically **low or inappropriately normal** in severe iron deficiency anemia because iron-restricted erythropoiesis limits marrow output despite anemia [^115TJZBu]. This reflects an **inadequate marrow response** and helps distinguish iron deficiency from hemolytic or hemorrhagic states, where the reticulocyte index is elevated [^116116vp]. A low reticulocyte index in severe iron deficiency anemia is a key diagnostic clue and can guide further evaluation and management [^111Y5frp].

---

## Pathophysiology of reticulocyte production in iron deficiency anemia

Iron deficiency anemia impairs hemoglobin synthesis, causing microcytic, hypochromic anemia and **reduced reticulocyte production** [^115TJZBu]. The marrow response is constrained by iron availability, so the reticulocyte index remains low or inappropriately normal despite anemia [^111Y5frp].

---

## Reticulocyte index in severe iron deficiency anemia

In severe iron deficiency anemia, the reticulocyte index is typically **low or inappropriately normal** because iron-restricted erythropoiesis limits marrow output despite anemia [^115TJZBu]. This reflects an **inadequate marrow response** and helps distinguish iron deficiency from hemolytic or hemorrhagic states, where the reticulocyte index is elevated [^116116vp].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting low reticulocyte index in iron deficiency anemia

Clinical studies and guidelines consistently show that iron deficiency anemia presents with a **low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte index** [^115TJZBu]. This pattern reflects iron-restricted erythropoiesis and helps differentiate iron deficiency from other anemias [^116116vp].

---

## Clinical implications of low reticulocyte index in iron deficiency anemia

A low reticulocyte index in severe iron deficiency anemia has **important clinical implications**:

- **Diagnostic clue**: A low reticulocyte index in the setting of anemia suggests iron deficiency or other causes of impaired erythropoiesis [^116116vp].

- **Monitoring response**: After initiating iron therapy, the reticulocyte index should rise within 3–5 days, indicating an appropriate marrow response [^116uyCh6].

- **Differentiation**: Helps distinguish iron deficiency anemia from hemolytic or hemorrhagic anemia, where the reticulocyte index is typically elevated [^117St36s].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

While the reticulocyte index is useful, certain factors can confound its interpretation:

- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation can suppress erythropoiesis, potentially masking the expected rise in reticulocyte index after iron therapy [^113kyg1Z].

- **Concurrent conditions**: Mixed anemia (iron deficiency anemia combined with anemia of chronic disease) may complicate interpretation of the reticulocyte index [^notfound].

- **Laboratory variability**: Differences in laboratory methods and reference ranges can affect reticulocyte index values [^116s8CQo].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Reticulocyte index** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe iron deficiency anemia | Low or inappropriately normal | Iron-restricted erythropoiesis limits marrow response [^115TJZBu] |
| Hemolytic anemia | Elevated | Increased erythropoiesis due to hemolysis [^117St36s] |
| Hemorrhagic anemia | Elevated | Increased erythropoiesis due to blood loss [^117St36s] |
| Anemia of chronic disease | Low or inappropriately normal | Inflammatory suppression of erythropoiesis [^113V21dv] |

---

The reticulocyte index is typically **low or inappropriately normal** in severe iron deficiency anemia due to iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^111Y5frp]. This pattern helps differentiate iron deficiency from hemolytic or hemorrhagic anemia and can guide diagnosis and management [^117St36s].

### The validity of reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells for screening iron-deficiency anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease: a retrospective analysis [^1175rZ7x]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical treatment and quality of life for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This study aimed to evaluate the validity of CHr and %Hypo in screening IDA among ESRD patients and compare their performance with screening IDA among non-ESRD patients.

Method

A retrospective analysis of 312 participants was conducted at Cho Ray Hospital, Vietnam, including healthy control participants and ESRD patients. Receiver operator characteristics curves and the area under the curve (AUC) of models were used to evaluate the performance of CHr, %Hypo. Optimal cut-off values were determined using Youden's index.

Results

Detecting IDA in ESRD patients is more complicated, as the screening performance of CHr and %Hypo in predicting IDA among ESRD patients were lower than non ESRD group, but still reasonable with AUC = 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656–0.840, power = 0.997) and 0.740 (95% CI: 0.647–0.833, power = 0.996), respectively. Cut-off values of CHr < 31.5 pg and %Hypo > 10.0 pg are recommended to obtain optimal screening ability for Vietnamese ESRD patients.

Conclusion

CHr and %Hypo appears to be useful tools for screening IDA among both non ESRD and ESRD patients. The low cost and accessible of the two markers encourage their utility as effective screening tools in clinical practice.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

Other laboratory parameters have also been suggested as candidates for identifying iron deficiency in inflammatory states. Reticulocyte Hb content is an early marker of iron deficiency that can identify patients who may respond to iron supplementation and is unaffected by inflammation.–A reticulocyte Hb content below 29 pg per cell is suggestive of IDA. The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) may also be useful because it is elevated in IDA and not by inflammation. The ratio of sTfR and log of ferritin (ferritin index) has been used to identify IDA.–At this point, hepcidin, reticulocyte Hb, and sTfR testing are not readily available in many hospitals. However, as these tests become more generally available, they may become useful in clinical practice.

Several algorithms for the evaluation of anemia have been published, all of which have different strengths and weaknesses. We suggest using the algorithm published in 2017 by Muñoz et al, as it has the benefit of simplicity and highlights the wide range of factors that can cause or contribute to anemia. Also, it is focused only on diagnosis and classification, meaning that it is not complicated by recommendations on treatment.

Management

Consensus Statements: Treatment of Preoperative Anemia

The aim of treating preoperative anemia is to improve Hb concentration and this may decrease RBC transfusion.
Therapy should be tailored to the etiology of anemia.

Supporting Evidence: Treatment of Preoperative Anemia

As described above, preoperative anemia is associated with worsened clinical outcomes. Existing evidence also shows that treating this condition with iron therapy and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may increase Hb levels and decrease RBC transfusion rates see the sections, Supporting Evidence: Preoperative Iron Therapy, and Supporting Evidence: Preoperative Treatment With ESAs. The data suggest that treatment of anemia should be initiated some time (eg, several weeks) before surgery to enable the full effects to be attained. However, there are differences between treatment modalities in their speed of onset, and combination therapy with IV iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B 12, and oral folic acid has been shown to be effective in the immediate perioperative period.

Discussion

Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in both the general population and among patients undergoing major surgery. The importance of screening and treatment of ID before major surgery is increasing. However, performing laboratory analysis for ID is costly. In addition, defining ID can be challenging due to the lack of standardized diagnostic approaches. Various methods are employed, often relying solely on ferritin or using a combination of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, transferrin saturation, and CRP. Furthermore, the cutoff values for ferritin levels can vary significantly from 15 ng/ml in healthy individuals to as high as 300 ng/ml in patients with inflammation, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure.

In this context, reticulocytes, which are immature red blood cells released from the bone marrow into circulation one to two days before maturation, can provide valuable insights. An increase in the reticulocyte count indicates heightened erythropoiesis. Therefore, the Ret-He may serve as a promising marker that offers a real-time reflection of iron availability for red blood cell production, potentially enhancing the diagnosis of ID.

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia (IDA) management includes trying oral iron first in children with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and/or quiescent disease, with response to oral therapy determined by repeating Hb in 2 to 4 weeks; adequate response is an increase in Hb ≥ 1 g/dL in 2 weeks or ≥ 2 g/dL in 4 weeks, and reticulocyte response can be observed as early as 4 days with maximal response at 7 to 10 days; parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, in patients with moderate-severe anemia and/or active inflammation, and according to ECCO guidelines an IV replacement goal of achieving a ferritin level of up to 400 μg/L is more likely to prevent recurrence of anemia, while a transferrin saturation < 50% and serum ferritin of 800 μg/L should not be exceeded.

Soluble transferrin receptors

An up-regulation of the number of soluble transferring receptors (sTfR) on the cellular membranes continuously moving into the plasma is consistent to all cases of functional iron deficiency, its extent being entirely independent of chronic inflammation or hepatic damage. Thus, the determination of sTfR has been reported to be a reliable indicator of iron deficiency.

However, sTfR concentrations are also increased in every expansion of erythropoiesis (i.e. hemolytic anemia, thalassemia or polycythemia) and reduced in aplastic anemia and other conditions with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis (e.g. renal anemia). This assay has been found to have a specificity for IDA of 84%, but a PPV of only 54%, and has been demonstrated to be less accurate than serum ferritin. Likewise, the combination of ferritin and sTfR (sTfR/log ferritin ratio) proposed by Punnonen has not proved effective as a more accurate means of differentiation between IDA and ACD. These data are in contrast to a recently published case-control study in eanemic IBD demonstrating that a sTfR –Index > 1.4 had a 91% sensitivity and 92% for the diagnosis of IDA. Disadvantageous for the routine diagnostic use of the TfR-F index are its lack of uniform reference range (the reference ranges of the individual components are assay-dependent) and the relatively high costs. It may be hypothesized, that the combination of hematologic markers such as reticulocyte hemoglobin content, which decreases with iron deficiency, and R/F ratio may allow for a more precise classification of anemias.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (initiation), UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to ensure patients are iron replete as defined below to achieve and aim to maintain the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving ESAs:

- percentage hypochromic red cells < 6%, content of hemoglobin in reticulocytes or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent > 31 pg, ferritin and transferrin saturation > 100 mcg/L liter and > 20% in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis, and > 200 mcg/L in patients on hemodialysis

- ferritin > 100 mcg/L for children with CKD on dialysis, as well as children with CKD not on ESAs

- consider administering iron when ferritin is < 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 30% to ensure iron repletion.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to consider measuring red cell zinc protoporphyrin concentration as an alternative to indices of RBC hypochromia or reticulocyte hemoglobin content for assessing functional iron deficiency, recognizing that the former is less sensitive than the latter to acute changes in iron availability. Obtain measurements on washed cells, with the use of appropriate reference limits, when used in the assessment of functional iron deficiency in patients with CKD.

Reticulocytes

Reticulocytes are those immature erythrocytes still containing sufficient RNA as to be microscopically detectable using specific alkaline stains. This blood count parameter (%) is obtained by flow cytometry and is available in all larger laboratories at a reasonable cost.

In chronic anemias that have reached a steady state, relative reticulocyte count correlates inversely, though non-linearly, with the shortening of the erythrocyte lifespan. The absolute reticulocyte count, on the other hand, is a gauge for for effective erythrocyte production by the bone marrow.

The reticulocyte production index (RPI) describes the relative reticulocyte count (RTC, in %) corrected to the severity of the anemia (patient's hematocrit [HCT-P] in relation to ideal hematocrit [HCT-N = 0.45] and reticulocyte maturation time [RMT]):

RPI = (RTC x HCT-P) / (HCT-N [0.45] × RMT)

The RPI thus represents the increase or decrease in erythrocyte production as a factor of the normal value 11.

Serum ferritin

Serum ferritin is an indicator of the storage iron content of the RES, and is therefore employed to detect malfunction in cellular iron storage. The reference range is 15–100 μg/L for women and 30–200 μg/L for men; a serum ferritin concentration of 100 μg/L represents about 1000 mg of stored iron. Reduced concentrations are a sign of iron deficiency and a serum ferritin concentration < 15 μg/L is considered an indication of absolute iron deficiency. However, because both ferritin and transferrin belong to the family of acute-phase proteins, these reference ranges cannot be applied to patients with active IBD. Recent guidelines therefore recommend that, in the presence of inflammation (i.e. CRP > 5), sensitivity and specificity can be improved by using a cutoff value ≤ 100 µg/L.

### Using the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) to evaluate anemia in patients with cancer [^113Tzry3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluation of anemia, particularly iron deficiency, in patients with cancer is difficult. This study examined using the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) to rule out iron deficiency, as defined by serum iron studies (transferrin saturation < 20%, serum iron < 40 μg/dL, and ferritin < 100 ng/mL), in an unselected cancer patient population.

Methods

Patients were entered into the study based on the existence of concurrent laboratory test requests for CBC and serum iron studies.

Results

Using a threshold of 32 pg/cell, RET-He ruled out iron deficiency with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.5% and 100%, respectively, in the study population (n = 209) and in a subpopulation of patients with low reticulocyte counts (n = 19). In comparison, the NPV of traditional CBC parameters (hemoglobin, < 11 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, < 80 fL) was only 88.5%.

Conclusions

These results support the use of RET-He in the evaluation of iron deficiency in a cancer care setting.

Follow up

The goal of iron supplementation should always be complete normalization of Hb and iron storage. It should be kept in mind that even after normalization of Hb levels, iron storages are still not filled up because anemia is only the end point of iron deficiency. Iron treatments should be followed up clinically and using laboratory tests at least within 4 weeks in asymptomatic patients and more frequently in symptomatic patients. An important surveillance factor is the wellbeing of the patient. Clinically, QoL can improve within a few days after initiation of iron therapy and previous symptoms of anemia decrease.

An adequate erythropoietic response has been defined as an increase of Hb of at least 2 g/dl or normalization within 4 weeks. As described above, reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index are faster parameters of successful treatment and will be increased within 1–2 weeks following oral or intravenous iron with or without EPO.

As described above, iron storage can be assessed using ferritin and transferrin saturation. During oral or intravenous iron supplementation, transferrin saturation can be falsely elevated. Ferritin levels also overestimate the iron available for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow during intravenous iron treatment. Therefore, assessment of iron storage should only be performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the last intravenous iron application. After termination of iron therapy, the parameters of iron storage should be above the lower limits of normal. A recent study has pointed out that the time until reoccurrence of iron deficiency in patients with IBD can be delayed with higher post-treatment ferritin values above 100 μg and even more so above 400 μg/liter. However, it was suggested that a ferritin level of 800 μg/liter and a transferrin saturation of 50% should be used as upper limits for intravenous iron to prevent iron overload.

Patients on oral iron should be monitored clinically about tolerability and side effects. In oral iron therapy, ferritin can be used for monitoring during treatment and is expected to increase within 1–2 weeks and Hb levels should also be monitored.

If a patient is on oral iron and the erythropoetic response is not adequate, or if oral iron is not tolerated, the patient should be switched to intravenous iron. If treatment with intravenous iron is not successful, other causes of anemia should be reevaluated. If (concomitant) ACD is possible, additional use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors should be considered. Optimal treatment of the underlying IBD is also an important factor in the treatment of anemia at all levels.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111V71Fg]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little information in literature to guide the approach to CKD patients who show laboratory evidence of iron deficiency. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of GI blood loss due to variety of causes in this patient population, deciding on a subsequent management plan, including endoscopy, depends on the clinical presentation. This supports the recommendation that CKD patients who present with anaemia and iron deficiency should undergo careful clinical assessment prior to the initiation of anaemia therapy.

Reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis can manifest as low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), but given the relatively long lifespan of circulating erythrocyte, this test will not reflect the existing availability of iron at the time of testing. Testing the reticulocytes for their Hb content (CHr or Ret-He) may allow more accurate estimation of iron availability, because reticulocytes are present in the circulation for 4–5 days, so give a discrete population to study. Reduced red cell Hb can be reflective of reduced haem availability or globin. Therefore, the red cell analyte values (%HRC, CHr, Ret-He) may be affected by the presence of haemoglobinopathies.

Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

We recommend that patients should be iron replete to achieve and maintain target Hb whether receiving ESAs or not. (1B)

Iron repletion in is usually defined as:
%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg / ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For Children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA Therapy. (ungraded)

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — anemia definition and ferritin threshold context note that in adults with anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in nonpregnant women, determining iron deficiency is an important step, and diagnosing iron deficiency has proposed ferritin cutoff values ranging from 15 to 100 ng/mL; studies that use bone marrow biopsy as the gold standard have defined the sensitivity and specificity of ferritin levels at different cutoff values.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^116s8CQo]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

To diagnose iron deficiency in patients undergoing hemodialysis, the percentage of hypochromic RBCs (with cellular hemoglobin concentration < 280 g/L [HYPO%]) and mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHret) provided by the Siemens ADVIA 120 and 2120 analyzers (Siemens Diagnostic Solutions, Tarrytown, NY) were proposed as alternatives to biochemical tests. Sysmex, with its XE-5000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), also proposed the percentage of erythrocytes with cellular hemoglobin content lower than 17 pg (%Hypo-He) and equivalent of the mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-He) with similar clinical applications. Our aim was to verify the clinical usefulness of the biochemical and cellular parameters as predictors of iron deficiency in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. We studied 69 patients undergoing hemodialysis 3 times weekly. The baseline values of serum ferritin and percentage of transferrin saturation were poor predictors of iron responsiveness. Better ability was demonstrated by reticulocyte indices (area under the curve [AUC], 0.74 for CHret and 0.72 for Ret-He; best cutoff values, 31.2 and 30.6 pg, respectively) and erythrocyte parameters (AUC, 0.72 for HYPO% and 0.68 for %Hypo-He; best cutoff values, 5.8 and 2.7, respectively). The newly proposed Ret-He and %Hypo-He can provide clinicians with information equivalent to CHret and HYPO%.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113bSGbB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although current guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, current observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, etc.), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our current understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^112rkjre]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia with and without comorbidities.

Methods

Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were used in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia with no secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using the mean values.

Results

The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while 26 to 31.5 pg can distinguish iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

Conclusions

Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### Screening healthy infants for iron deficiency using reticulocyte hemoglobin content [^115TF6K6]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Current clinical practice relies on hemoglobin to detect iron deficiency, which misses infants not yet anemic and places them at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) has never been compared with hemoglobin for screening healthy infants.

Objectives

To evaluate CHr for detecting iron deficiency without anemia in healthy 9- to 12-month-old infants and to compare CHr with hemoglobin in screening for iron deficiency in this population. A secondary objective was to explore the association between CHr and subsequent development of anemia.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A prospective observational cohort study of 202 healthy 9- to 12-month-old infants from an urban, hospital-based, primary care clinic in Boston, Mass, who were screened for iron deficiency between June 2000 and April 2003, and followed up for a median of 5.6 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Iron deficiency (transferrin saturation < 10%) and anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL).

Results

Of 202 infants enrolled, 23 (11.4%) had iron deficiency and 6 (3%) had iron deficiency and anemia. Iron-deficient and non-iron-deficient infants had significantly different values for all measured hematological and biochemical markers for iron deficiency. Optimal CHr cutoff for detecting iron deficiency was 27.5 pg (sensitivity, 83% and specificity, 72%); a hemoglobin level of less than 11 g/dL resulted in a sensitivity of 26% and a specificity of 95%. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content was more accurate overall than hemoglobin was for detecting iron deficiency (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.85 vs 0.73; p = 0.007). A CHr of less than 27.5 pg without anemia at initial screening was associated with subsequent anemia when screened again in the second year of life (risk ratio, 9.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–78.9; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

A CHr of less than 27.5 pg is a more accurate hematological indicator of iron deficiency compared with hemoglobin of less than 11 g/dL in these healthy 9- to 12-month-old infants. Further studies are warranted to determine whether CHr should be the preferred screening tool in the early detection of iron deficiency in infants.

### A new indicator derived from reticulocyte hemoglobin content for screening iron deficiency in an area prevalent for thalassemia [^1145mVUe]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish a new indicator derived from reticulocyte hemoglobin (Ret-He) content and red blood cell (RBC) indices for screening for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in an area in whch thalassemia is prevalent.

Methods

Blood specimens from 304 women aged between 18 and 30 years residing in northeast Thailand were collected and measured for RBC and reticulocyte parameters. Iron deficiency was diagnosed when a participant had a serum ferritin level of less than 15 ng per mL. Thalassemia genotypes were defined by hemoglobin (Hb) and DNA analyses.

Results

Of the total participants, 25% had iron deficiency (ID) and 50% carried the thalassemia gene. Various mathematical formulas were established and analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The formula derived from Ret-He: (Ret-He/RDW-SD) × 10, was the best predictor for identifying ID among participants (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.812). Further testing of this indicator among individuals with positive thalassemia-screening results revealed stronger performance with an AUC of 0.874.

Conclusions

The findings indicate that the formula derived from Ret-He might be applicable for screening ID in areas in which thalassemia is prevalent.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115aMMTD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a relative new marker for iron metabolism. It is a truncated soluble form of the transferrin receptor that correlates with the total mass of cellular transferrin receptors on erythroid precursor cells of the bone marrow. Its concentration correlates with increased iron need in the bone marrow either in the case of (functional or absolute) iron deficiency or in situations with increased erythropoiesis (e.g. hemolysis). It is reduced in conditions with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis (aplastic anemia, renal anemia). An advantage compared with the above discussed markers is that the concentration is entirely independent from inflammation or hepatic function.sTfR and an index of sTfR/ferritin have been proposed as indices to differentiate between IDA and ACD. Nevertheless, data are conflicting about its sensitivity and specificity compared with conventional markers like ferritin. But a relatively new study from 2011, investigating 100 patients with IBD, suggested that the sTfR/ferritin index was the most sensitive marker for IDA in IBD with the benefit of being independent of disease activity. Disadvantages are the high costs and the lack of a uniform reference range up to now.

Clinical routine

As described above, many diagnostic options exist to identify iron deficiency and IDA. However, depending on the clinical situation, a small test panel is usually sufficient. The 2015 ECCO guidelines recommend a CBC (including MCV and reticulocyte count), ferritin, TfS and CRP. More extensive workup depends on the clinical situation and availability. It may include vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, bilirubin, LDH, creatinine and urea, sTfR and other parameters.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Reticulocyte subpopulations and reticulocyte maturity index (RMI) rise as body iron status falls [^113kQeAC]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate the influence of body iron status on reticulocyte subpopulations and reticulocyte maturity index (RMI), we measured serum iron markers, fluorescent intensity of reticulocytes, and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations in 374 females aged 14–19 years. Reticulocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry, and sTfR concentration was measured by enzyme immunoassay. There were no significant differences in the values of reticulocyte subpopulations and RMI between ferritin alone-depleted group and healthy controls. However, middle- and high-fluorescence reticulocytes and RMI were significantly higher in both the serum iron- and serum ferritin-depleted groups than in the ferritin alone-depleted group. Middle-fluorescence reticulocytes and RMI increased gradually as the body iron store was depleted and were 3.4- and 3.6-fold higher, respectively, than normal controls, when the subjects attained a frank iron-deficiency anemia. There were no significant changes in the values of red blood cells or total reticulocyte counts during iron-depleted states. The mean value of sTfR (3.98 mg/l) in the subjects with RMI ≥ 1.5% was significantly higher than that (2.26 mg/l) in the subjects with RMI < 1.5% (P < 0.01). The sTfR concentration correlated significantly with RMI (r = 0.61, P < 0.01) and middle-fluorescence reticulocytes (r = 0.59, P < 0.01). In short, body iron depletion induces elevation of immature reticulocyte fractions and RMI.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of ⁵⁹Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing ⁵⁹Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113V21dv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) and reticulocyte indices — red cell size factor (RSf), RDW, and IRF: many RBC parameters are affected by the long lifespan of erythrocytes (about 120 days). RSf, defined as the square root of MCV multiplied by mean reticulocyte volume (MRV), correlates with CHr and, when low, indicates iron deficiency anemia; a level below 98.6 fL was found to be 83% sensitive and 98% specific, with positive predictive value 67% and negative predictive value 92%. High RDW combined with low RSf is highly predictive of iron deficiency, and the immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) is an early and sensitive index of erythropoiesis useful for distinguishing increased versus decreased erythropoietic activity.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^114GEthU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of IBD and can substantially affect the quality of life of patients with IBD. Although there are several causes of anemia in IBD, IDA is the most common. Assessment of the iron status of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, by using common biochemical values is insufficient. However, new indices of iron metabolism (i.e. TfR Index, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percentage of hypochromic red blood cells) may help to improve the assessment of iron status in patients with IBD. The major goal when treating IDA in patients with IBD is first to supply sufficient iron to increase hemoglobin levels by > 2 g/dL or increase them to normal values within 4 weeks and second to replenish iron stores (ferritin levels > 100 g/L). Transferrin saturation levels > 50% and ferritin levels > 800 g/L are considered toxic and should be avoided. Besides, in patients with mild IDA and quiescent or clinical active IBD, IV iron should be the preferred route for iron supplementation. Fig. 3 summarizes our current work-up for the management of IDA in patients with IBD.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^114AZaQK]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and characteristics of anemia in patients with RDEB

Anemia was present in 50% (42/84) of the RDEB cohort, with mild anemia in 10 of 42, moderate in 30 of 42, and severe in 2 of 42 cases. No sex-based differences were observed (supplemental Table 3). The youngest patients with anemia were aged 4 years (n = 2). The prevalence of anemia escalated from 5 years of age (P < .0001), with no significant difference between children and adults thereafter (Figure 1 A). After this study, 5 patients passed away, including 2 of 2 with severe anemia and 3 with hemoglobin levels between 9.4 and 10.3 g/dL, suggesting anemia as a potential mortality risk factor in RDEB, as reported in other chronic conditions. Hematological parameters, including reticulocyte production index (RPI), are described in the supplemental Table 4 and supplemental Figure 1.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in patients with IBD [^1114ViX9]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of IBD. It can affect quality of life and ability to work, and can also increase the hospitalization rate in patients with IBD. Although the causes of anemia in IBD are multifactorial, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common. Assessment of the iron status of patients who have a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, by using common biochemical values is insufficient. However, new indices of iron metabolism (for instance ferritin:transferrin receptor ratio, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or percentage of hypochromic red blood cells) may help to improve the assessment of iron status in patients with IBD. The treatment of IDA traditionally involves oral iron supplementation. However, because of extensive gastrointestinal adverse effects, and data showing that the use of oral iron in IBD may be associated with disease exacerbation, current guidelines suggest that iron supplementation in IBD should be administered intravenously. This Review provides an overview of iron homeostasis in health before discussing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for IDA in patients with IBD.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^112cyDmC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recently, reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-He) has been evaluated as an early marker for ID diagnosis. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that reflect the responsiveness of the bone marrow, and their hemoglobin content correlates with the functional availability of iron for erythropoiesis. In contrast to ferritin, Ret-He is not influenced by inflammation. It is the first peripheral blood count marker being abnormal in the presence of ID. Ret-He has a short life span of 1–2 days and enables an early detection of ID. However, there are currently no standardized thresholds for Ret-He in the diagnosis of ID. This study investigated the significance of Ret-He in diagnosis of ID in major surgical patients.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117DEawE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (MCHr) in the assessment of iron deficient erythropoiesis in inflammatory bowel disease [^111bSr6N]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In conditions associated with inflammation, biochemical parameters alone could be inadequate for assessing iron status. We investigated the potential utility of mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (MCHr) in the assessment of the erythropoiesis status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Methods

We recruited 124 anemic outpatients with IBD. Serum iron, transferrin and ferritin were tested. Complete blood counts were performed on a CELL-DYN Sapphire analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics). Differences among groups were assessed using analysis of variance, considering P < 0.05 to be significant. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of MCHr for detecting iron deficient erythropoiesis. The reference used as an indicator of insufficient iron availability was transferrin saturation < 20%.

Results

Overall, 47.6% of the patients had iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and 31.5% anemia of chronic disease (ACD), while the others (20.9%) had mixed anemia. Patients with ACD or mixed anemia showed functional iron deficiency: normal or high ferritin and low MCHr. The area under curve was 0.858 (95% CI 0.742–0.942), considering a cut off 30.3 pg, the sensitivity was 82.2%, specificity 83.3%.

Conclusions

MCHr provides information on iron availability in IBD patients. It is a reliable test to assess iron supply for erythropoiesis.

### The validity of reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells for screening iron-deficiency anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease: a retrospective analysis [^111nih4g]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several studies have proposed CHr and %Hypo as promising markers to detect IDA. However, the performance of these tests in ESRD patients and Vietnamese population have yet to be validated. In this study, we investigated the performance of CHr and %Hypo in screening IDA among ESRD patients and compared them with non ESRD population to provide evidence of their utility in resource-limited settings.

Among non ESRD control participants, high correlation between CHr, %Hypo and Hb, MCV, MCHC suggested that CHr and %Hypo are likely to have the same effect with conventional markers on screening anemia. The correlation coefficients in ESRD patients were significant and followed a similar trend, although their magnitudes were less than those in the control group. The findings were consistent with results from Nalado et al. Likewise, difference in the distribution of CHr and %Hypo were more significant between IDA patients and healthy participants, which resulted in better performance of the two tests in predicting IDA with AUC up to 0.979 and 0.993, respectively. We found that sensitivity and specificity for CHr were 99.3 and 98.3%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 29.4 pg. This performance is higher than finding from Mustafa et al. with a cut-off of 29 pg which showed sensitivity and specificity at 90.6 and 66.7%. In terms of %Hypo, our suggested cut-off is 7.2 pg for sensitivity of 91.5% and specificity of 100.0%.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113DECq2]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log₁₀ ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction, and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells in response to therapy. An algorithm for the diagnostic approach to IDA is suggested in figure 1.

Diagnosis of IDA in CLD

When evaluating a patient with CLD IDA everyone should have in mind that the tests commonly used in the general population show a wide variation in these patients, because they are affected directly or indirectly by the hepatic cell damage.

The laboratory methods used in the diagnosis of IDA can be divided into two categories. There are screening measurements (Hb, Tsat, mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular Hb [MCH], red blood cell distribution width [RDW], and reticulocytes) that detect iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and measurements that indicate tissue iron status, either by measuring storage proteins or by direct examination of bone marrow aspiration for ID. The only definitive method still remains bone marrow aspiration, stained with Prussian blue for iron. However, the fact that the procedure is invasive, painful and expensive makes biopsy a tool that is not frequently used, and there is need for less- or even noninvasive tests with a good diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective study performed at the University Hospital Frankfurt and University Hospital Würzburg. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Frankfurt (Ref. 318/17) and the requirement for written informed consent by patients was waived. Data were extracted from the anemia outpatient clinic of both hospitals.

Cutoff values

Anemia was defined according to the WHO, with Hb values of < 12 g/dl for women and < 13 g/dl for men considered anemic. Iron deficiency was defined by serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml or serum ferritin 100–300 ng/ml and transferrin saturation < 20%. Accordingly, patients were assigned to a Control group (no anemia, no ID), ID group (no anemia, ID), IDA group (anemia, ID) or Others group (anemia of unknown cause, no ID).

Reticulocyte hemoglobin content was measured by fluorescence flow cytometry in the reticulocyte channel of the XN-1000 or XN-9000 (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany).

In comparison with healthy control group, CHr can discriminate non-IDA ESRD patients with AUC = 0.618 (95% CI: 0.517–0.719, power = 0.725), the AUC of %Hypo was 0.644 (95% CI: 0.537–0.751, power = 0.877). Combination of CHr and %Hypo increased the AUC to 0.732 (95% CI: 0.641–0.822, power = 0.999). The optimal cut-off value for %Hypo is 4.2 pg, which results in 52.0% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity. Likewise, CHr can discriminate IDA ESRD patients from healthy control group with AUC = 0.692 (95% CI: 0.599–0.784, power = 0.993), AUC of %Hypo was 0.876 (95% CI: 0.809–0.943, power = 1.000). A combination of CHr and %Hypo had AUC = 0.876 (95% CI: 0. 809–0.944, power = 1.000). The optimal cut-off value for CHr is 29.5 pg for sensitivity of 98.6% and specificity of 43.6%; %Hypo is 5.2 pg for sensitivity of 72.4% and specificity of 92.4%.

Results

Between September 2017 and January 2023 2,966 patients undergoing major surgery were screened for the presence and possible causes of anemia in the anemia outpatient clinic at the University Hospital Frankfurt and University Hospital Würzburg. Of the 2,966 patients 2,769 had laboratory values for Hb, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and Ret-He and were included in analysis. Among them 487 (17.6%) patients had ID, 412 (14.9%) patients had IDA and 370 (13.4%) patients had anemia but no ID. The total prevalence of preoperative anemia was 28.2%.

The proportion of female patients was highest in the ID group with 45.4% compared to the IDA group with 38.3% and to the Others group with 25.1%. Patients of the IDA (70 (61; 78) years) and Others (70 (62; 77)) group were significantly older compared to patients of the Control (66 (57; 73)) and ID (64 (55; 73)) group (p < 0.001) (Table 1). Ret-He was significantly decreased in patients of the IDA group compared to ID, Control and Others, respectively (p < 0.001) (Table 1, Fig. 1).

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Transferrin saturation versus reticulocyte hemoglobin content for iron deficiency in Japanese hemodialysis patients [^114qQ8d3]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is a frequent cause of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO)-resistant anemia in hemodialysis patients. Both reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) have been proposed as markers of iron deficiency, but it is unclear which parameter is superior.

Methods

To compare the efficacy of CHr and TSAT as an indicator for treatment of iron deficiency, we conducted a single-center, open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled trial at the Kidney Center in Shinraku-en Hospital of 197 Japanese patients on chronic hemodialysis. After 4 weeks of run-in period during which iron supplementation was suspended, 100 patients who were randomized to the CHr group received 240 mg iron colloid intravenously over 2 weeks when CHr less than 32.5 pg, and 97 patients who were randomized to the TSAT group received the same doses of iron colloid when TSAT less than 20%. We measured the rhEPO dose needed to maintain prestudy hematocrit levels, hematocrit, CHr, TSAT, serum ferritin, percentage of hypochromic red blood cells, and total iron administered.

Results

Sixteen weeks later, 94 patients in the CHr group and 89 patients in the TSAT group finished the study. The doses of rhEPO required decreased by 35.8% (4081 to 2629 U/week, P < 0.005) in the TSAT group, but not significantly in the CHr group (4121 to 3606 U/week). Although CHr increased promptly after the iron administration in both groups, TSAT increased only in the TSAT group.

Conclusions

Although CHr reflects the iron status more sensitively, TSAT is a better clinical marker for iron supplementation therapy.

### Reticulocyte haemoglobin content as a marker of iron deficiency [^112UKjED]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr), compared with ferritin, transferrin saturation (TS) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), as a marker of iron deficiency (ID).

Design

Retrospective analysis of clinically indicated blood samples taken between February 2010 and October 2012.

Setting

Single-centre neonatal care unit.

Patients

210 very preterm (gestational age < 32 weeks) or very low birthweight infants (birth weight < 1500 g) at 3–4 months corrected age.

Main Outcome Measures

Complete blood count, CHr, ferritin and TS determined as part of a standard follow-up examination. To detect the optimal CHr cut-off, ID was defined by the presence of more than two of the following three criteria: MCV < 75 fL, TS < 10%, ferritin < 30 µg/L.

Results

210 preterm infants were included at a corrected age of (median (IQR)) 3.5 (3.0–4.0) months and with a CHr of 29.7 (28.6–30.7) pg. There were correlations between CHr and MCV (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001) and between CHr and TS (r = 0.44, p < 0.0001). There were 27 (13.4%) iron-deficient infants, and two infants (1%) fulfilled criteria of ID-anaemia. CHr was lower in infants with ID (26.4 (23.8–28.7) pg) than in those without (29.9 (29.0–30.8) pg, p < 0.0001). The optimal CHr cut-off for detecting ID was 29 pg (sensitivity 85%, specificity 73%). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of ID tended to be higher for CHr compared with ferritin (0.92 vs 0.75), TS (0.90 vs 0.82) and MCV (0.81 vs 0.72).

Conclusions

CHr seems to be a suitable marker for latent ID in preterm infants at 3–4 months corrected age and may be superior to ferritin, TS and MCV.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to follow-up, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to monitor patients in the first 4 weeks for hemoglobin response to oral iron and continue treatment for a period of around 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin level to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^113kyg1Z]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a genodermatosis characterized by severe cutaneous and mucosal fragility, and frequently complicated by multifactorial chronic anemia that responds poorly to conventional therapies. This cross-sectional study investigates the factors contributing to anemia in RDEB by analyzing a representative cohort, that was stratified by disease severity, anemia, and iron status, to examine their hematological parameters, cytokine profile, and the erythropoietin-erythroferrone-hepcidin (EPO-ERFE-hepcidin) axis. Anemia was present in 50% of the cohort. Hemoglobin levels showed a strong negative correlation with the percentage of body surface area affected and C-reactive protein levels (CRP), identifying these as anemia risk factors in RDEB. Moderate-severe inflammation (CRP ≥ 15 mg/L) was observed in all patients with anemia, but no specific cytokine profile was linked with anemia risk because of variability in interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ levels. The regulation of the EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis showed discrepancies with the patterns expected based on patients' anemia severity and iron status. According to the reticulocyte production index, an inadequate bone marrow response was observed in 90% of patients with anemia, irrespective of EPO levels. Patients with functional or true iron deficiency had higher ERFE levels, although ERFE showed no consistent correlation with EPO and was elevated in both patients with anemia and those without anemia. Elevated hepcidin was primarily linked to the highest ferritin levels, mostly in patients with a history of iron infusions and/or transfusions. These findings highlight the need for personalized, targeted approaches that address the complex interplay between inflammation and iron dysregulation, to improve anemia management in RDEB and other chronic inflammatory conditions.

We also calculated the sensitivity of Ret-He at a specificity greater than 90% for diagnosing ID in both anemic and non-anemic patients. A specificity of over 90% was achieved in both groups using a Ret-He cutoff value of 33.1 pg, with a sensitivity of 63.6% in anemic patients and 35.5% in non-anemic patients.

Anemia of unknown causes

Off the 370 patients with anemia of unknown cause (Others group) 131 had Ret-He levels < 33.5 pg. In these patients, the median values of laboratory parameters were as follows: ferritin 492.0 ng/ml (333.5; 818.5 ng/ml), transferrin saturation 11.9% (18.0; 23.3%), transferrin receptor 3.9 mg/l (3.1; 5.3 mg/l), MCH 28.5 pg (26.9; 29.5 pg), MCV 85.7 fl (82.5; 89.3 fl), and CRP 2.8 mg/dl (0.4; 7.7 mg/dl) (Additional Fig. 3).

Predictors for iron deficiency

The logistic regression analysis identified several significant predictors of ID. Lower Hb levels were associated with a 19.4% increase in the odds of ID (OR = 0.806; p < 0.001), while a decrease in Ret-He was associated with a 26% increase in odds (OR = 0.740; p < 0.001). Additionally, each unit increase in CRP was associated to a 15.1% decrease in the odds of ID (OR = 0.849; p < 0.001). In contrast, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular MCH, and anemia status did not show significant associations with ID (Additional Fig. 4).

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^113MPkLy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypochromic erythrocytes/reticulocytes

Recent research by Thomas et al has confirmed cytometry of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) and the percentage of hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) to have a high predictive value in the differential diagnosis of IDA, even when inflammation and ACD are present. While a reduction in %HYPO (mean lifetime of 120 days) denotes a longer-term deficiency in iron supply, reduced CHr (mean lifetime of 48 h) is an indicator of current iron deficiency, providing an accurate measurement of bioavailable iron over the previous 3–4 days (Table 3). In hemodialysis patients, CHr < 29 pg has been demonstrated to be a more accurate measure of functional iron deficiency than the combined use of ferritin and TfS. Furthermore, CHr measurement may serve to predict the response to intravenous (IV) iron therapy within 2–4 days after onset. However, there are no data available from IBD patients.

### Soluble transferrin receptor-ferritin index in the evaluation of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study [^111vLbsX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The pathophysiological background of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been established to represent two main types: iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of inflammation, or anemia of chronic disease (ACD), with the former being the most prevalent and common. Many IBD patients present with a mixed-type anemia, where both types participate to a variable extent, due to the ongoing inflammation which takes place in the level of enterocyte, even in patients in clinical and biochemical remission. This mixed-type anemia is one of the most frequent and difficult clinical problems to diagnose and treat for the IBD practitioner, due to the difficulty to determine the extent to which each type is responsible for the final clinical setting in the individual patient. Unfortunately, conventional biochemical markers for the evaluation of iron status, such as ferritin and transferrin, in these patients are frequently unreliable, because they are influenced by the presence of inflammation and therefore not useful in the diagnosis of anemia in the case of IBD. On the other hand, a variety of new generation indices (hepcidin, percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration, immature reticulocyte fraction, red blood cell size factor and reticulocyte distribution width) are under investigation in the literature and some of them seem very promising in the evaluation of anemia in patients with IBD.

Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a truncated form of the cellular transferrin receptor, without its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and circulates bound to transferrin. The number of sTfR reflects the cellular requirements for iron, and varies with the function and the morphological development of each cell type. In IDA the numbers of sTfR increase significantly, whereas the serum concentration of sTfR is an indicator of the iron supply available for erythropoiesis; sTfR reflects erythropoiesis and inversely correlates with the amount of iron available for erythropoiesis. It seems that sTfR is not influenced by chronic or acute inflammation; therefore it could be a more reliable index in diagnosing IDA in patients with IBD. There is a growing amount of literature concerning the role of the sTfR/ferritin or sTfR/log ferritin ratio (sTfR-F index) in the evaluation of anemia in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, especially diagnosing IDA in the setting of chronic inflammation or discriminating iron deficiency in the absence of anemia. It seems that the sTfR-F index has a higher diagnostic power than either sTfR or ferritin alone. To the best of our knowledge, there is as yet no study in the literature evaluating the sTfR-F index in patients with IBD.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^117LrehM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the population and the leading cause of anemia with a prevalence of 23 to 33%. In clinical setting, preoperative anemia is associated with an increased risk for perioperative complications and mortality. Triphaus et al. showed that every second major surgical patients with a hemoglobin (Hb) level below 10 g/dl had ID. Both oral and intravenous administration of iron are effective and low-cost measures to treat anemia. However, it is important to recognize that treatment requires time to show its full effect. Oral iron typically takes three to six months, while intravenous iron can take at least seven days to improve iron levels and erythrpoiesis. Therefore, early detection of ID is crucial to ensure timely and effective management.

The diagnosis of ID is challenging. The cutoff values and measurements to diagnose ID have been rigorously debated in the last decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a ferritin cutoff value of < 15 μg/l in healthy individuals and < 70 µg/l in individuals with infection or inflammation for the diagnosis of ID. In the patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure, ferritin values of up to 300 ng/ml and transferrin saturation below 20% are also considered indicative for ID. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and often elevated if inflammation is present. Therefore, Muñoz and colleagues recommend a simultaneous measurement of ferritin, transferrin saturation and C-reactive protein (CRP) in surgical patients.

The detrimental impact of preoperative anemia has been consistently demonstrated. However, implementing a comprehensive anemia management strategy within clinical routines is complex. The limited time available between preoperative assessment and surgery necessitates a straightforward screening and treatment process to ensure accurate diagnosis and management of ID. Diagnostic accuracy is often challenged by factors such as inflammation or chronic disease, which can obscure true ID. Additionally, the lack of standardized protocols can lead to variability in how ID is screened and managed across different clinical settings. Since performing laboratory analysis for ID is costly, a pre-selection of potentially iron-deficient patients would be beneficial. Resource constraints in some healthcare environments further complicate access to full diagnostic panels, and integrating new diagnostic processes into established clinical workflows can be difficult. Furthermore, patient-specific factors, including comorbidities and nutritional status, add another layer of complexity to the diagnosis and management of ID.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^11653mjJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a prospective validation study on phase III, whose index-tests were the pre-treatment values of serum ferritin, red blood cell count, Hb, HTC, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW and reticulocyte count, and reference standard was the responsiveness to a therapeutic test with oral iron. This report was made according to the requirements of the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Initiative. The validation studies on phase III are conducted with a population in whom it is clinically sensible to suspect the target disease in a pragmatic real-world setting of routine clinical practice. Thereby, this study was conducted at a single pre-natal care center and compared the diagnostic tests in pregnant women previously classified as anemic, as they are under higher risk of iron-deficiency.

This study followed the ethics principles in research with human beings of the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of IMIP (registration number 2050/10). Each participant was oriented, read and signed the consent form prior to their inclusion in the study. As we applied a before-after intervention with medicinal iron, our protocol was inscribed in International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (U1111–1123–2605) of WHO, and in Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-237 registered 28 July 2011, available at:).

Participants and follow-up

Pregnant women attended at the prenatal care center of Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof Fernando Figueira (IMIP) were consecutively recruited based on a Hb value < 11 g/dL (WHO criteria for anaemia) in the routinely prenatal exams plus the following inclusion criteria: 18 to 35 years old, 12 th to 32 nd weeks of low-risk singleton pregnancy. Our prenatal service composes of the reference network assistance for pregnant women in the public health system in the state of Pernambuco, in the Northeast of Brazil, and performs an average of 17,000 outpatient consultations and 6,000 deliveries per year. The exclusion criteria were Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dL, history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to ferrous sulfate, disorders or mental deficits; use of tobacco, alcohol or other drugs; previous diagnosis of another cause of anaemia; or infection at the time of the enrollment (positive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus or syphilis, leukocytosis or leukocyturia with positive urine culture, clinical signs and symptoms of airway infection).

Determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) provides an early measure of functional iron deficiency because reticulocytes are the earliest erythrocytes released into blood and circulate for only 1 to 2 days. The CHr in 78 patients undergoing bone marrow examination was measured to assess its clinical utility for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. Twenty-eight patients were iron deficient, based on the lack of stainable iron in the aspirate. The diagnostic power of CHr is limited in patients with high mean cellular volume (MCV) or red cell disorders such as thalassemia. However, when patients with MCV more than 100 fL are excluded, receiver operator curve analysis of CHr, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV demonstrates that CHr has the highest overall sensitivity and specificity of these peripheral blood tests for predicting the absence of bone marrow iron stores.

### Low reticulocyte hemoglobin content is associated with a higher blood transfusion rate in critically ill patients: a cohort study [^116LathG]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often need blood transfusion, but no reliable predictors of transfusion requirements are available at ICU admission. The authors hypothesized that ICU patients with functional iron deficiency may be at higher risk for developing anemia, requiring blood transfusion. Their objective was to determine whether low reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) was associated with transfusion requirements in ICU patients.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study in a general ICU. The authors studied 62 patients, after excluding those transfused on or before ICU admission. The authors recorded age, diagnosis, severity score, presence of sepsis, ICU complications, ICU treatments, and transfusion-free interval. Threshold for low CHr was 29 pg. The authors also recorded ICU and hospital outcome. The statistical analysis included Cox proportional hazard function for transfusion.

Results

Twenty-three patients (37%) presented with low CHr on ICU admission and tended to be sicker and more likely to have sepsis than those with normal CHr. They were also more prone to complications, particularly acute renal failure (39 vs. 13% P = 0.02) and ICU-acquired infection (30 vs. 10% P = 0.04). The overall transfusion rate was 22.6%, being higher in low-CHr patients than in normal-CHr patients (39.1 vs. 12.8%, P = 0.02). After adjusting for severity of illness, age, trauma, and hemoglobin level, low CHr remained significantly associated with transfusion, with a hazard ratio of 3.6 (95% CI, 1.2–10.7; P = 0.02). Median ICU stay was also longer in patients with low CHr (8 vs. 5 days, P = 0.01). Differences in mortality did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusion

Low CHr is common at ICU admission and is associated with higher transfusion requirements.

### The validity of reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells for screening iron-deficiency anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease: a retrospective analysis [^116PhWfo]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the characteristics and laboratory data over four groups of participants. Most ESRD patients were over 50 years old, while the majority of healthy and IDA patients were under 40 years old. The percentage of female in IDA, ESRD non-IDA and ESRD IDA group were higher than male, while they were relatively equivalent in the healthy group.

Table 1
Characteristics of participants

Among groups of participants, IDA patients had the lowest CHr and highest %Hypo (Fig. 1). CHr of IDA cases were lower than non-IDA among ESRD patients (p < 0.001) and healthy control group (p < 0.001). %Hypo of IDA were also significantly higher than IDA cases among ESRD patients (< 0.001) and control group (p < 0.001). Interestingly, CHr and %Hypo between non ESRD IDA patients and ESRD IDA patients are significantly different (both have p < 0.001).

Fig. 1
Distribution of CHR and %Hypo among groups of participants

Significant correlation coefficients were found between CHr, %Hypo and hematological parameters among both ESRD patients and control participants, as shown in Table 2. %Hypo showed negative correlations with Hb, MCV and MCHC, while CHr showed positive correlations.

Table 2
Correlation of CHr and %Hypo with other hematological parameters among ESRD patients and non ESRD participants

To detect IDA among non ESRD participants, CHr had AUC = 0.993 (95% CI: 0.978–1.007, power = 1.000), %Hypo has AUC = 0.979 (95% CI: 0.949–1.008, power = 1.000) (Fig. 2 a). Combination of CHr and AUC had AUC = 0.991 (95% CI: 0.973–1.000, power = 1.000). The optimal cut-off value for CHR is 29.4 pg for sensitivity of 99.3% and specificity of 98.3%; %Hypo is 7.2 pg for sensitivity of 91.5% and specificity of 100.0%.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^113YLrwi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

### Characterization and differentiation of iron status in anemic very low birth weight infants using a diagnostic nomogram [^113kZC1U]. Neonatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In the early weeks of life, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants experience intense laboratory blood sampling leading to clinically significant anemia and the need for red blood cell transfusion. Although controversial, treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) and iron has been recommended to stimulate erythropoiesis; optimal dosing of EPO and iron is still uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the validity of a four-quadrant diagnostic plot of iron availability (ferritin index) versus iron demand for erythropoiesis (reticulocyte hemoglobin content, CHr) for differentiating iron status in anemic VLBW infants.

Methods

Study subjects were enrolled in a previously reported randomized controlled trial of clinically stable VLBW infants < 31 weeks' gestation and < 1,300 g at birth to receive 18 days of treatment with: group 1: oral iron; group 2: EPO + oral iron, and group 3: EPO + intravenous + oral iron.

Results

At the end of treatment the ferritin index was significantly higher in both EPO groups compared to the control group. By day 18, CHr of the control group declined into the quadrant of the diagnostic plot characteristic of functional iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease. Both EPO groups ended in the quadrants that are characteristic for latent iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, respectively.

Conclusions

The diagnostic plot for differentiating anemia in VLBW infants may be an informative, clinically useful tool for iron status assessment under different physiologic and therapeutic erythropoietic states. Larger additional studies in difficult patient populations are needed before the clinical utility of this diagnostic procedure can be unequivocally confirmed.

### Iron deficiency and red cell indices in patients with heart failure [^117U1KAT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) in heart failure (HF) patients with normal vs. abnormal red cell indices (RCI), the associations between iron parameters and RCI, and prognostic consequences of ID independently of RCI.

Methods and Results

We analysed clinical data of 1821 patients with HF [mean age 66 ± 13 years; 71% men; New York Heart Association class I/II/III/IV (11%/39%/44%/6%); left ventricular ejection fraction > 45%: 19%]. Iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 µg/L or ferritin 100–299 µg/L with transferrin saturation < 20%) was common irrespective of the presence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL in women and < 13 g/dL in men) or low RCI, from 75% in anaemic subjects with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and MCH concentration (MCHC), to 36% in non-anaemic subjects with MCV, MCH, and MCHC above the lower limit of normal. After adjustment for clinical variables, iron parameters remained independently associated with haemoglobin, MCV, MCH, MCHC, mean reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHR), and red cell distribution width (RDW). In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models there was a trend towards higher mortality in patients with vs. without ID when adjusted for relevant HF prognosticators and MCH or MCHC (but not haemoglobin, CHR or RDW).

Conclusions

Patients with HF should be routinely screened for ID irrespective of the presence of anaemia or abnormal RCI. The detrimental impact of ID on long-term survival in HF is partially independent of RCI.

### The validity of reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells for screening iron-deficiency anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease: a retrospective analysis [^111onpk6]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common complication among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which occurs in over 50% of non-dialysis-dependent patients. The severity of anemia is intimately associated with the stage of kidney damage, of which up to 75.5% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are presented with anemia. Insufficient production of erythropoietin due to kidney failure and iron deficiency are the most common factors causing anemia among CKD patients. On average, an ESRD patient on hemodialysis treatment is estimated to lose ≥ 2000 mg of iron per year due to several reasons such as occult blood loss, nutritional conditions, infection, systemic inflammatory conditions or remaining blood in the dialyser equipment. Early detection of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) can significantly enhance the effectiveness of clinical treatment which results in better patient outcomes, reduce treatment cost and improve their quality of life.

The most commonly used test to diagnose anemia is hemoglobin, a subtance derived from all types of red blood cells from early progenitors to mature erythrocyte with an average lifespan of around 120 days, which makes the impacts of iron deficiency on hemoglobin requires significant time to be observed. On the other hand, storage of iron in bone marrow is the current gold standard to examine iron status. Obtaining this index requires bone marrow biopsy, an invasive procedure which is impossible to apply in routine practice, thus indicating iron often rely on indirect indices such as serum concentrations of iron, ferritin, or transferrin saturation (TSAT). Although they are the most familiar to physicians hence had been widely used, concerns had been raised that these markers do not ensure correlation with bone marrow iron stores or hemoglobin response to iron. Moreover, in resource-limited developing countries, ferritin and TSAT are not available in all facilities, especially small hospitals and community health center.

### A new concept for the differential diagnosis and therapy of anaemia in cancer patients [^115bvCDU]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to prove the usefulness of the diagnostic plot, using the haemoglobin content of reticulocytes as a measure of functional iron deficiency (FID) and the ferritin index as a measure of iron availability, to customise anaemia treatment in cancer patients.

Methods

Based on results of this plot, cancer patients fulfilling practice guideline criteria to receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were allocated to treatment with ESAs alone, iron alone or the combination of both. Primary endpoint was the percentage of patients identified to require iron in addition or as an alternative to ESA therapy.

Results

Out of 303 patients screened, 286 were allocated to treatment: 204 patients were normochromic and iron replete and treated with ESAs alone, 22 had both FID and anaemia of chronic disease and were treated with ESAs and parenteral iron, and 60 were iron-depleted and treated with iron only. After 8 weeks, a haemoglobin increase > 1 g/dL from baseline was shown by 56% of patients treated with ESAs alone, by 100% of patients receiving the combination, by 50% of normochromic and by 73% of hypochromic iron-depleted patients receiving iron only. Acute phase reaction did not diminish the response rate to ESAs.

Conclusions

The diagnostic plot was superior to transferrin saturation and ferritin in predicting iron availability in hypochromic patients treated with ESAs and proved useful to select treatment for anaemia in cancer patients.

### Mature erythrocyte indices: new markers of iron availability [^1158K38Y]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

This study was aimed at evaluating mature erythrocyte indices as new markers of iron status. Contrarily to those in the whole red blood cell (RBC) population, mature erythrocyte parameters are valid markers of iron status that remain independent of erythropoietic activity. When reticulocytosis is low, these parameters are similar to whole RBC parameters.

### The new reticulocyte parameter (RET-Y) of the sysmex XE 2100: its use in the diagnosis and monitoring of posttreatment sideropenic anemia [^117AVe21]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

To verify their clinical usefulness in diagnosis and early response to therapy of sideropenic anemia, we compared the behavior of the reticulocyte parameter (RET-Y), a raw measure dependent on size and content of the cell, generated by the Sysmex XE 2100, with the mean reticulocyte volume (MCVr) and mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) from the Bayer ADVIA 120 in healthy subjects and patients with iron deficiency anemia. Correlations were high (r = 0.88 and r = 0.94, respectively). All parameters varied significantly as early as 48 hours after the start of intravenous iron therapy (mean differences of 17.4% [RET-Y], 4.5% [MCVr], and 9.5% [CHr]). Sudden decreases in those parameters at interruption of therapy indicate the reappearance of sideropenic erythropoiesis. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated a high degree of efficiency in differentiating moderate or severe iron deficiency anemia from the healthy state. The best association between sensitivity and specificity was at a cutoff of channel 1,624 for RET-Y and 104.5 fL for MCVr (negative and positive predictive values, respectively, of 99.6% and 96.5% for RET-Y and 98.7% and 93.3% for MCVr). RET-Y is correlated closely with CHr and is useful for diagnosis and early monitoring after the administration of intravenous iron.

Detecting IDA in ESRD patients is more complicated due to the impact of underlying inflammatory condition which resulted from several factors such as uremia, infections, the presence of indwelling dialysis catheters and comorbidities. Indeed, results have shown that unlike in the control group, the AUC of CHr to predict IDA in ESRD patient was only 0.692. However, %Hypo alone can discriminate IDA ESRD patients from healthy control group with AUC = 0.876 (95% CI: 0.809–0.943). This result is consistent to Tessitore et al. which also indicated %Hypo as the most accurate markers to predict response to intravenous iron. The European best practice guidelines has recommend using either %Hypo, CHr, or TSAT to detect functional IDA. One caution when using %Hypo is that the corpuscular hemoglobin concentration can be degraded over time, a phenomenon known as red blood cell swelling, therefore the accuracy of this test requires short storage time of blood sample. However, unlike in the United States where laboratories are national centralized which increased transportation and storage time, laboratories in Vietnam are local and have short storage time just as in Europe, the utility of %Hypo is feasible and reasonable.

The AUC of CHr and %Hypo to predict ESRD non-IDA patients were low, indicating the two parameters are specific markers for iron status rather than other causes of anemia. Among anemia ESRD patients, CHr and %Hypo can discriminate IDA and non-IDA cases with AUC = 0.748 and 0.740, respectively. A combination of the two markers can increase the AUC to 0.776 (95% CI: 0.690–0.862), which is consistent to a study from Nalado et al. in which the AUC was 0.76. Unlike Nalado et al. concluded that using CHr alone is sufficient to detect IDA in their study population, our results showed that combining CHr and %Hypo can improve the accuracy, though not much, in comparison with a single test.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content [^116wq1aL]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Under normal conditions, reticulocytes are the youngest erythrocytes released from the bone marrow into circulating blood. They mature for 1–3 days within the bone marrow and circulate for 1–2 days before becoming mature erythrocytes. Measurement of cellular hemoglobin concentration has long been reported by automated hematology analyzers as one of the red blood cell indices. The reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr or Ret-He) provides an indirect measure of the functional iron available for new red blood cell production over the previous 3–4 days. Measurement of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in peripheral blood samples is useful for diagnosis of iron deficiency in adults (Mast et al. Blood 2002;99:1489–1491) and children (Brugnara et al. JAMA 1999;281:2225–2230; Ullrich et al. JAMA 2005;294:924–930; Bakr and Sarette, Eur J Pediatr 2006;165:442–445). It provides an early measure of the response to iron therapy increasing within 2–4 days of the initiation of intravenous iron therapy (Brugnara et al. Blood 1994;83:3100–3101). Sequential measurements of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in patients with iron deficiency anemia provide a rapid means for assessing the erythropoietic response to iron replacement therapy (Brugnara et al. Blood 1994;83:3100–3101). It is also an early indicator or iron-restricted erythropoiesis in patients receiving erythropoietin therapy (Fishbane et al. Kidney Int 1997;52:217–222; Fishbane et al. Kidney Int 2001;60:2406–2411; Mittman et al. Am J Kidney Dis 1997;30:912–922; Tsuchiya et al. Clin Nephrol 2003;59:115–123; Chuang et al. Nephrol Dial Transplant 2003;18:370–377). Thus, reticulocyte hemoglobin content is a recent addition to an expanding list of biomarkers that can be used to differentiate iron deficiency from other causes of anemia.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### The validity of reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells for screening iron-deficiency anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease: a retrospective analysis [^1125vFzx]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several alternative markers have been proposed in recent years, of which reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (%Hypo) are the most promising. The reticulocytes last only 24 to 48 h in circulation before developing into mature red blood cells. During the initial stages of iron deficiency, insufficient iron supply would causes a decline of hemoglobin production in reticulocytes in bone marrow, which can be detected through reticulocyte hemoglobin content. Indeed, measuring CHr provides more updated information about functional state of the bone marrow iron status, the development, progression and response to treatment of iron deficiency. Percentage hypochromic red blood cells is a parameter to indicate the percentage of red blood cells contains low level of haemoglobin. Not only an indicator of iron restricted erythropoiesis, %Hypo can also reflect the functional iron status several months before early clinical manifestations of anaemia can be observed. A research from Tessitore et al. had shown that %Hypo is even more accurate than ferritin, TSAT and CHr in predicting IDA among hemodialysis patients.

Similar to other developing countries, ferritin and TSAT have not been available in all hospitals and might cause additional economic burden for patients in Vietnam. Meanwhile, CHr and %Hypo cost only one-fourth as much as other haematological parameters and are currently available on many hematology analyzers which does not cause additional payments. Utilization of the two parameters would be beneficial to population in developing countries with resource-limited settings. While studies have shown CHr and %Hypo as efficient predictor for iron deficiency, no consensus was found for a global threshold. Cut-off values of CHr and %Hypo vary according to study population, previous studies had suggest to determine specific cut-off for each target population, but the available cut-off values are not validated in Vietnamese population. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of CHr and %Hypo in screening iron deficiency anemia among ESRD patients in comparison with non ESRD group. We also investigated the distribution of CHr and %Hypo in different groups of patients to further examine whether a fixed cut-off value can be applied to predict IDA in normal population and ESRD patients.

### Utility of reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent in screening for iron deficiency in pregnancy [^113bFyN6]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin, commonly used for diagnosing iron deficiency (ID) in pregnancy, is limited by high cost and false elevations during inflammation. Reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He), an alternative marker for ID, is unaffected by inflammation and analyzed on the same collection tube as the standard complete blood count (CBC). We aimed to determine the accuracy of Ret-He in detecting ID in pregnancy compared to ferritin in a U.S. cohort. This prospective cohort study enrolled 200 pregnant participants, recruited in any trimester if a CBC was drawn as part of routine prenatal care. For those who agreed to participate, Ret-He and ferritin were collected concurrently with the CBC. ID was defined as ferritin level below 30ng/mL. Patients were classified into three groups based on hemoglobin and ferritin results to determine the severity of ID: no ID, ID alone, and ID anemia (IDA). Four participants with anemia but normal ferritin were excluded. Receiver operating curve analysis, including the area under the curve (AUC), was performed to assess the accuracy of Ret-He in detecting ID. A one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with post-hoc analysis was used to compare differences in Ret-He between the three groups of ID severity. The prevalence of ID in our cohort was 82% (161/196). The AUC for Ret-He was 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.55–0.75), indicating suboptimal discrimination between patients with and without ID. Ret-He was significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.001). In post-hoc analysis, Ret-He was significantly lower in the IDA group compared to the ID group (p < 0.001) but there was only a trend of lower Ret-He in the ID group compared to the non-ID group (p = 0.38). Ret-He has low accuracy in diagnosing ID in pregnancy. It may be useful in detecting severe ID resulting in anemia but not a mild iron-deficient state resulting in ID only. · The prevalence of ID in our cohort was 82%. · Ret-He has low accuracy in diagnosing ID in pregnancy. · Ferritin is preferable when readily available.

### The role of reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent on the evaluation of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pediatric cyanotic heart disease: a diagnostic study in Indonesia [^114zQinT]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The previous study stated that early increment of iron storage (compensated secondary erythropoiesis) was marked by increasing hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte levels. This study demonstrated the presence of compensated secondary erythropoiesis, as seen by the higher mean hemoglobin level in the iron deficiency without anemia group (20.2 g/dL) compared to the normal iron status group (17.1 g/dL). Subsequently, as the progression occured, uncompensated secondary erythropoiesis was followed by decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. In this study, uncompensated secondary erythropoiesis seen on the mean hemoglobin level on IDA was 13.6 ± 1.88 g/dL and mean hematocrit 44.73 ± 7.92.

The utilization of erythrocyte index (MCV, MCH, MCHC, and RDW) to assess iron deficiency in pediatric CHD had conflicting results in previous studies. MCV and RDW are stable parameters on secondary polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia. MCV < 80 fL was used as a cut-off value for the progression of iron depletion in pediatric CHD. In contrast to another study, MCV could be influenced by secondary erythropoiesis, which physiologically increased the production of young erythrocytes with a greater volume. Therefore, their usage should be combined (MCV < 80 fL and MCH < 27 pg). This study showed a lower mean value of MCV and MCH in all iron status groups, in accordance with a previous case-control study on pediatric CHD.

Studies had shown that the performance of CHr and %Hypo in detecting IDA among early stages CKD patients (stages I and II) are better than later stages (IV and V), thus specific cut-off values should be proposed to different stages of CKD. Consistent with Kim et al. cut-off of 32 pg to determine IDA among haemodialysis patients, our results found that the CHr cut-off value of 31.5 pg is optimal for Vietnamese ESRD patients. In terms of %Hypo, the cut-off value was 10.0 pg, which is consistent to common recommendations on this parameter. In our validation experiment, although the combination of two markers only has specificity of 18.2%, high sensitivity of 95.3% and PPV of 81.6% was observed which confirmed its performance as an adequate screening tool for IDA among ESRD patients.

Conventional iron tests such as ferritin or TSAT cost around $25–$30, while CHr and %Hypo is significantly cheaper with only $5–$7 and can be performed on several common hematology analyzers. Using CHr and %Hypo as screening tools for IDA would reduce economic burden for ESRD patients, which is especially important for patients in resource-limited countries.

Study limitations

The main limitation of this study was its retrospective design, which may be subject to bias. Due to lack of resources, iron deficiency anemia was defined using serum ferritin and TSAT as reference instead of the gold standard bone marrow aspiration. As ferritin and TSAT are widely used and accepted in current clinical practice, we believe that our study design and results are valid for the purpose of validating screening tools for IDA. Sample size was small and the study was conducted on Vietnamese patients only, which may limit the capacity of generalising our findings. However, our validation experiment on a public data has shown that the markers have high sensitivity and PPV, which are acceptable for the screening purpose.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^112knLuE]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — ferritin cutoff for diagnosing iron deficiency in anemia states: In patients with anemia, the AGA recommends using a cutoff of 45 ng/mL over 15 ng/mL when using ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency. This is a Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114J4SK1]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^113SHZQi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The AUC detecting ID was 0.775 (95% CI (0.76–0.81)) in ID/IDA patients, with a sensitivity of 74.1% (95% CI ((71.2–77.9%)) and a specificity of 65.9% (95% CI ((63.5–68.1%)) at a threshold of 34.6 pg for Ret-He in the ID/IDA patients (Fig. 2).

We performed a classification performance evaluation to assess the binary classification model's effectiveness. For diagnosing ID in anemic patients, a Ret-He cutoff value of 33.5 pg resulted in an accuracy of 62.8%, with a precision of 78.3% and a recall of 72.8%. The F1 Score of 75.4% reflects a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, indicating a reasonable performance despite moderate overall accuracy.

For diagnosing ID in non-anemic patients, using a Ret-He cutoff of 34.6 pg yielded an accuracy of 67.6%, with a precision of 76.1% and a recall of 68.3%. The F1 Score of 72.1% again indicates a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, suggesting that the model performs reasonably well by correctly identifying positive cases while limiting false positives.

The fivefold cross-validation demonstrated an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI (0.80–0.88)) with a specificity of 98% (95% CI (97.1–98.9%)) and a sensitivity of 48.8% (95% CI: 42.9–54.6%) in IDA patients. For ID patients, the AUC was 0.72 (95% CI (0.71–0.75)), with a specificity of 97.6% (95% CI (96.1–99.2%)) and a sensitivity of 19.1% (95% CI (17.3–20.7%)) (Additional Fig. 2).

### The validity of reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells for screening iron-deficiency anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease: a retrospective analysis [^1162QoFr]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Among anemia ESRD patients, CHr can discriminate IDA and non-IDA cases with AUC = 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656–0.840, power = 0.997), similar to %Hypo with AUC = 0.740 (95% CI: 0.647–0.833, power = 0.996). A combination of two markers increases the AUC to 0.776 (95% CI: 0.690–0.862, power = 1.000). The optimal cut-off value for CHr is 31.5 pg with sensitivity of 66.0% and specificity of 77.6%. The optimal cut-off value for %Hypo is 10.0 pg which returns sensitivity of 46.6% and specificity of 92.0%. Using both markers yields a sensitivity of 79.3% and specificity of 64%, with a positive predicted value (PPV) of 71.9%.

Public dataset from Nalado et al. comprises of 42 IDA ESRD and 11 non-IDA ESRD patients was used to validation the identified cut-off thresholds. Combination of the two markers has sensitivity = 95.3%, specificity = 18.2%, and PPV = 81.6%.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.
