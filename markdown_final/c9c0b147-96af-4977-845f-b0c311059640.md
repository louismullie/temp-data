## Question

A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a pre-employment examination. She has no complaints. She has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. She exercises daily and plays soccer recreationally on the weekends. Her mother was diagnosed with hypertension at a young age. She does not smoke and drinks 2 glasses of wine on the weekends. Her current medications include an oral contraceptive pill and a daily multivitamin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac examination shows a grade 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Peripheral pulses are normal and there is no lower extremity edema. An electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with a normal axis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Exercise stress test
B. No further testing
C. Transthoracic echocardiogram
D. CT scan of the chest with contrast

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step in management is most appropriate for a 26-year-old asymptomatic woman with a new grade 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the apex and a normal ECG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the murmur characteristics and whether they fit a pathologic pattern. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about new diastolic murmurs and when echocardiography is indicated. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for an apical diastolic murmur and how echocardiography clarifies it. After that, I need to check why the other options are less appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and follow-up plan anchored to guideline-based care.

> Let me first confirm the murmur features and their implications. A decrescendo diastolic murmur at the apex is classically concerning for mitral regurgitation with a diastolic filling complex or for mitral stenosis, both of which are pathologic rather than innocent, even when the intensity is soft at grade 1/6, because diastolic murmurs are not considered innocent in adults and often reflect structural valve disease even when subtle on auscultation [^113yZD8w] [^1113Tz7P].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before jumping ahead. The ACC/AHA valvular heart disease guideline states that transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the standard initial diagnostic test for known or suspected valvular heart disease, and that new diastolic murmurs warrant evaluation with TTE to define etiology and severity, even in asymptomatic patients, because physical examination alone cannot reliably characterize valve lesions or their hemodynamic impact [^116bPXrZ]. I should also confirm that bedside ultrasound and auscultation have limits; while cardiac ultrasound can screen for significant valvular lesions, a comprehensive TTE with Doppler is required for definitive diagnosis and grading in suspected valvular disease, especially diastolic lesions [^1167WyyE].

> Hold on, I should review the differential for an apical diastolic murmur. Mitral regurgitation with a diastolic filling complex (S3 plus short diastolic murmur) suggests significant regurgitant volume and can be surprisingly soft on exam, while mitral stenosis produces a mid-to-late diastolic rumble and opening snap when present; both entities are best characterized by TTE with 2D imaging and Doppler, which can quantify regurgitation severity, valve morphology, and hemodynamic consequences that are not discernible on auscultation alone [^113yZD8w] [^1113Tz7P]. But wait, what if this is aortic regurgitation radiating to the apex? Even then, TTE is the correct next test to distinguish AR from mitral pathology and to assess valve structure and ventricular response, so the management pathway remains the same [^113zgvAk].

> I need to ensure I am not overcalling the need for advanced imaging. CT angiography of the chest is not indicated for an isolated diastolic murmur without chest pain, suspected aortic disease, or other red flags; it exposes the patient to radiation and contrast without addressing the valvular question, and guidelines reserve CT for specific anatomic questions rather than initial murmur evaluation [^111bLPAq]. Similarly, an exercise stress test would not characterize a diastolic murmur and is inappropriate as a first test here, and choosing "no further testing" would ignore the pathologic nature of a diastolic murmur and the potential to miss clinically important valve disease that could affect future care or activity counseling [^113zgvAk].

> Let me consider the patient's context and risk modifiers. She is young and asymptomatic, but a new diastolic murmur remains pathologic until proven otherwise; the normal ECG does not exclude significant valvular disease, and the absence of symptoms does not preclude early or moderate lesions that can progress silently, which is precisely why guidelines endorse TTE for new diastolic murmurs even in asymptomatic adults [^113zgvAk]. I should double-check that this applies beyond specialty settings; perioperative guidance also recommends TTE for new murmurs without other signs, reinforcing the general principle that echocardiography is the appropriate next step when a new murmur is detected [^116bPXrZ].

> Next, I should review the downstream implications once TTE is obtained. If TTE is normal, I can document an innocent flow murmur or physiologic regurgitation and avoid unnecessary follow-up; if TTE reveals significant mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, or another valve lesion, I can stage severity, assess ventricular size and function, and plan surveillance or referral according to lesion-specific guideline pathways, including periodic clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to detect progression before symptoms emerge [^1163jCg9] [^113zgvAk]. Hold on, I should verify that discordance between exam and echo is addressed; guidelines advise correlating history, physical, and noninvasive testing, and pursuing further evaluation if there is discordance, which underscores the centrality of TTE in this scenario [^111Dbf2m].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the recommendation clearly. The most appropriate next step is a transthoracic echocardiogram to characterize the new diastolic murmur, because diastolic murmurs are pathologic, auscultation cannot reliably grade severity or define etiology, and TTE is the guideline-endorsed first-line test for suspected valvular heart disease in adults, including asymptomatic patients with new murmurs [^113zgvAk] [^111bLPAq].

> Final answer: C. Transthoracic echocardiogram [^113zgvAk] [^111bLPAq].

---

The most appropriate next step is a **transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)** [^113zgvAk] to evaluate the cause and severity of the diastolic murmur, as diastolic murmurs are pathologic and require definitive imaging [^111bLPAq]. TTE is noninvasive, widely available, and the standard first-line test for suspected valvular heart disease [^111bLPAq]. Exercise stress testing is not indicated in an asymptomatic patient with a diastolic murmur, CT angiography is unnecessary without specific suspicion of aortic disease, and no further testing is inappropriate given the pathologic nature of diastolic murmurs [^111bLPAq].

## Clinical significance of diastolic murmurs

Diastolic murmurs are **always pathologic** and indicate underlying structural heart disease, such as valvular regurgitation or stenosis [^notfound]. Common causes include:

- **Mitral stenosis**: Typically produces a mid-diastolic rumble at the apex [^notfound].
- **Aortic regurgitation**: Often presents as an early diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at the left sternal border, but may also be heard at the apex [^111SumE1].
- **Mitral regurgitation**: Severe MR may produce a diastolic filling complex, including an S3 and a short diastolic murmur [^113yZD8w].

Given the patient's age and lack of symptoms, congenital or degenerative valvular disease is possible, but **further evaluation is warranted** to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity [^113zgvAk].

---

## Role of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)

TTE is the **gold standard initial diagnostic test** for evaluating suspected valvular heart disease [^113zgvAk]. It provides detailed information on:

- **Valve anatomy and function**: Identifies structural abnormalities, such as thickened or calcified leaflets, prolapse, or flail leaflets [^111bLPAq].
- **Severity of regurgitation or stenosis**: Quantifies the degree of valve dysfunction using Doppler measurements [^116BFF45].
- **Ventricular function**: Assesses left ventricular ejection fraction and chamber sizes, which are critical for management decisions [^111Ydgw9].
- **Associated abnormalities**: Detects additional lesions, such as atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects, that may influence management [^113FD7mV].

TTE is **noninvasive, widely available, and safe**, making it the most appropriate next step in this clinical scenario [^113zgvAk].

---

## Alternative diagnostic options and their limitations

### Exercise stress testing

Exercise stress testing is primarily used to evaluate suspected coronary artery disease or exercise-induced arrhythmias. It is **not indicated** in asymptomatic patients with a diastolic murmur, as it does not provide information about valvular structure or function [^116zxafJ].

---

### CT scan of the chest with contrast

CT angiography is useful for evaluating suspected aortic disease, such as aneurysms or dissections, but is **not indicated** in this patient without specific clinical suspicion. It involves radiation exposure and contrast administration, which carry potential risks [^notfound].

---

### No further testing

Given the pathologic nature of diastolic murmurs, **no further testing is inappropriate**. Failure to evaluate the underlying cause could result in missed diagnosis of significant valvular disease, potentially leading to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or infective endocarditis [^111Ydgw9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend TTE as the **initial diagnostic test** for patients with suspected valvular heart disease [^113zgvAk]. Specifically, TTE is indicated for:

- **Newly detected murmurs**: Especially diastolic murmurs, to evaluate for underlying valvular disease [^116zxafJ].
- **Asymptomatic patients**: With suspected valvular disease, to assess severity and guide management decisions [^111bLPAq].
- **Routine follow-up**: For patients with known valvular disease, to monitor progression and guide timing of intervention [^1163jCg9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step in the evaluation of a 26-year-old asymptomatic woman with a grade 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the apex is to perform a **transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)** [^113zgvAk]. This noninvasive test will provide definitive information regarding the cause and severity of the murmur, guide subsequent management, and ensure that any underlying valvular disease is appropriately addressed [^111bLPAq].

Clinical Introduction

A 28-year-old man with extensive travel history to developing countries was hospitalised for intermittent sharp chest pains, worst when supine and with inspiration. Two weeks prior to presentation, he had suffered a flu-like illness with a sore throat, which was resolving. Physical examination was notable for mild fever and tachycardia with cervical lymphadenopathy and painful bilateral knee and wrist effusions. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a soft early-peaking systolic murmur over the aortic area with a decrescendo early diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge. There was mild leucocytosis, elevation of serum troponin and acute-phase reactants with an ECG showing sinus tachycardia. Echocardiographic windows were extremely limited but suggested the presence of pericardial effusion and aortic regurgitation. Cardiac MRI was performed (figure 1). Viral, microbiological and autoimmune testing was remarkable only for significant elevation of antistreptolysin-O titres (1450IU rising to 1940IU, normal < 200IU). Pericardiocentesis revealed an exudative effusion, which was negative by cytology and microbiological analysis, including for tuberculosis and fungi.

Mitral regurgitation — auscultatory clues distinguishing primary versus secondary MR: In primary MR, the presence of a diastolic filling complex (S3 plus short diastolic murmur) is usually associated with a significant regurgitant volume and severe MR, and one or more non‑ejection clicks may be audible. Differential radiation can suggest leaflet pathology, with murmurs from anterior leaflet flail directed to the axilla and left infrascapular area, whereas murmurs from posterior leaflet flail radiate anteriorly and can be confused with systolic ejection murmurs. With secondary MR, the murmur is usually best heard at the apex and radiates to the axilla, and an S3 gallop is harder to interpret because it may reflect underlying LV dysfunction.

Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) — postoperative complications and clinical triggers: Left atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation or stenosis requiring reoperation may occur in approximately 5% to 10% of patients, and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction may occur in 5% of patients. In patients with prior repair, the onset of atrial arrhythmias should prompt a search for an underlying hemodynamic abnormality; subaortic obstruction should be ruled out when there is a loud or harsh systolic murmur, and an apical diastolic rumble without evidence of left-sided heart volume overload should prompt evaluation for left AV valve stenosis, particularly when there is evidence of PAH.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Cqw8q]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) clinical presentation — most encountered cases, symptom progression, and examination findings are described as follows: Most TR cases clinically encountered are secondary in nature and not related to primary diseases of the valve leaflets or chordae, such as infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid, and Ebstein anomaly. Mild-to-moderate degrees of TR are usually well tolerated in the short to intermediate term and may be clinically silent, but with increasing TR severity, symptoms of systemic venous congestion, such as edema and those reflective of reduced forward cardiac output, including dyspnea and fatigue, may emerge, and more advanced manifestations of right-sided congestion, such as abdominal bloating, worsening peripheral edema, weight gain, and anorexia, are ominous. Most patients with chronic severe secondary TR are older and have a significant burden of other cardiac and systemic comorbidities, and women outnumber men in most large observational series and atrial fibrillation (AF) is common. TR on bedside physical examination is more often "seen" than "heard", with severe TR showing elevated venous pressure and a prominent, systolic cv wave with a rapid y descent (in the absence of tricuspid stenosis), and the murmur of chronic TR being holosystolic in timing, high or medium pitched, and best heard at the lower left sternal border. An increase in murmur intensity during inspiration (Carvallo sign) can help distinguish it from other holosystolic murmurs, but when right atrial (RA) pressure is very high the murmur may not increase with inspiration, and in rare severe TR a diastolic murmur of functional tricuspid stenosis owing to enhanced diastolic flow can be appreciated.

Congenital absence of the pericardium — physical examination and risk/management indicate that "the apical impulse is laterally displaced past the midaxillary line with migratory apical pulsations", and "a systolic ejection murmur related to excessive motion of the heart may be present". Clinically, "patients with complete absence of the pericardium are usually asymptomatic and do not generally require intervention", whereas "patients with partial left-sided defects present with the greatest risk", including "compression, herniation, or strangulation of cardiac chambers… great vessels, or coronary arteries", and "indications for surgical repair include the presence of disabling symptoms or risk or occurrence of complications".

Aortic stenosis — Repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for changing signs or symptoms and stressors: In patients with known valvar AS, repeat TTE is prudent when physical examination shows an increase in the loudness of the murmur, the murmur peaks later in systole, the A2 component of the second heart sound is diminished or absent, or symptoms occur that might be attributable to AS. Repeat TTE is also appropriate in patients with AS who are exposed to increased hemodynamic demands, either electively, such as with noncardiac surgery or pregnancy, or acutely, such as with a systemic infection, anemia, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Evaluation and management of heart murmurs in children [^1158pR7y]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

### Dyspnoea on exertion in a 53-year-old woman [^1115cKPw]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 53-year-old woman with no previous medical history complained of easy fatigue over the last 6 months. She had a positive family history for coronary artery disease but no other risk factors. On physical examination, a 3/6 pansystolic murmur was heard over the apex, and the lung auscultation was unremarkable. Her ECG showed a left anterior fascicular block, with poor R wave progression in the anterior leads (see online supplementary image A). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a slightly dilated for the patient's body surface area (BSA) (1.73m 2) left ventricle (55/35mm), with preserved systolic function and a moderate functional mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery pressure was 45mm Hg. During treadmill radionuclide scintigraphy, her exercise tolerance was normal, with good inotropic response, and 96% oxygen saturation at rest and at peak exercise. A 2mm ST segment depression was noted at peak effort, which persisted well into recovery (see online supplementary image B). The scintigraphy scan showed extensive reversible anteroapical wall ischaemia (see online supplementary image C). At this point she was referred to us for right and left heart catheterisation. Intracardiac pressures and saturations were: right atrium (RA)RA = 3mm Hg, right ventricle (RV) = 26/3mm Hg, Pulmonary artery (PA) = 26/10/mean 16mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) = 11mm Hg, left ventricle (LV) = 110/10mm Hg, Aorta (Ao) = 110/60/mean 80mm Hg, Superior vena cava saturation (SVCsat) = 62%, RAsat = 62%, PAsat = 78%, Aosat = 96%and estimated pulmonary to systematic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) = 1.8. Her coronary angiography and CT angiography are shown in figure 1A, B.DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2017–311256.supp1Supplementary material 1 DC2SP210.1136/heartjnl-2017–311256.supp2Supplementary material 2 DC3SP310.1136/heartjnl-2017–311256.supp3Supplementary material 3 heartjnl;103/17/1390/F1F1F1Figure 1Coronary and CT angiograms.

### 47-year-old female with an apical mass [^112nm7rx]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 47-year-old female with no medical history presented with a sudden collapse. Physical examination, chest X-ray and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I were normal, however ECG demonstrated anterior T-wave inversion. CT pulmonary angiography was performed which ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed a non-calcified, homogenous mass at the left ventricular (LV) apex. It was not clear whether this mass was intramyocardial or pericardial. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the apical mass but was unable to establish its aetiology. Subsequent cardiac MR (CMR) demonstrated a highly vascular intramyocardial mass on perfusion imaging (Figure 1A, online supplementary video A), with striking, homogenous late gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1B) consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac fibroma.1 The patient underwent successful surgical excision of the mass (see online supplementary image A) and made a good symptomatic recovery, quickly mobilising around the ward. On examination, the patient was afebrile but had a blood pressure of 90/40mmHg and raised venous pressure. Postoperative imaging with echocardiography (see online supplementary video B) and CMR (Figure 1C, D and online supplementary video C) revealed some unexpected findings. Study the provided images.

Question

What is the next most appropriate management step? Antibiotic therapy for pericardial abscessAnticoagulation for LV thrombusIntravenous fluids with close clinical and imaging follow-up of the intramyocardial haemorrhage and pericardial haematomaReturn to theatre for excision of residual tumourUrgent pericardiocentesis to drain pericardial collection.

### The maverick heart sound [^113Q71Si]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

An asymptomatic 29-year-old woman presented for prenatal counselling. She had a history of a heart murmur since childhood and a previous echocardiogram suggesting 'enlargement of the heart'. Physical exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and contour. Precordial palpation was unremarkable. Auscultation, however, was abnormal; findings on inspiration and expiration are presented in Figure 1, sound clip.

Question

Based on the phonocardiogram and online supplementary audio clip, which of the following is correct? An early diastolic filling sound (S3) is heard, indicating increased right ventricular filling pressures. An ejection click without respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. An ejection click with respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with pulmonic valve stenosis. A holosystolic murmur with inspiratory augmentation is heard, indicating tricuspid regurgitation.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — postrepair clinical examination: The typical postrepair patient has a soft ejection systolic murmur from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT); a low-pitched, delayed diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area is consistent with pulmonary regurgitation, and such patients usually have an absent P2 component of the second sound. Additional findings may include a pansystolic murmur of a VSD patch leak and a diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Some adults may present after only a palliative shunt, and such patients usually have cyanosis and clubbing with a continuous murmur if the shunt is patent.

### A 59-year-old woman with visible precordial pulsations [^111SumE1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A retired 59-year-old woman presented to the cardiology clinic concerned with cardiac pulsations that were visible on her chest wall. These were not associated with dyspnoea, syncope or chest discomfort. Of note, 8years previously, she complained of recurrent nocturnal diaphoresis and 5kg weight loss. Blood sampling at that time revealed a microcytic anaemia, reactive thrombocytosis and raised inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 99mm/hour, C-reactive protein 161mg/L). Following an episode of transient diplopia, ophthalmoscopy demonstrated a cotton wool spot in the left inferotemporal retinal arcade. She commenced a 2-year tapering course of 1mg/kg prednisolone. On examination, she had a lean physique with a supine blood pressure of 162/60mm Hg and palpable Corrigan's pulse. She had a prominent apical pulsation and a loud early diastolic murmur was present at the left sternal edge radiating to the apex. Echocardiography showed severe central aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root (see online supplementary figure 1).

### Should we cross the valve: the risk of retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle in patients with aortic stenosis [^116AwyRX]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario

A 67-year-old man is referred to your cardiology clinic complaining of worsening angina and dyspnea on exertion. Physical examination reveals a harsh grade IV/VI late-peaking crescendo-decresendo systolic murmur, loudest at the upper sternal border. The aortic closure sound is diminished. Echocardiography demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 50%, no evidence of mitral regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a peak aortic gradient of 4.8 m/s (92 mm Hg) and a mean aortic gradient of 55 mm Hg. You schedule him for coronary angiography but wonder whether you should reevaluate his aortic valve gradient invasively.

Literature Search

Combining the keywords "aortic valve stenosis" and "heart catheterization/adverse effects", you find 72 articles. From these you choose the following: Omran H, Schmidt H, Hackenbroch M, et al. Silent and apparent cerebral embolism after retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve in valvular stenosis: a prospective randomized study. Lancet 2003;361:1241–6.

Question

What is the stroke risk of retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve in patients with AS?

Design

The study was prospective and randomized; unblinded treatment but with blinded assessment of outcomes.

Setting

The study was conducted at a single center in Bonn, Germany.

Patients

A total of 152 patients with known or suspected AS undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomized to catheterization with or without retrograde passage of the aortic valve in a 2:1 randomization format. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the day before and within 48 hours after cardiac catheterization. Patients with unclear echo findings or contraindications to MRI or transesophageal echocardiography were excluded. There were no significant baseline differences between the 2 groups: mean age 70.5 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 62%, and mean aortic valve gradient 51 mm Hg. All patients were evaluated in the groups to which they had been randomized and, other than the experimental intervention, the 2 groups were treated similarly (with the exception of the administration of 5000 units of intravenous heparin to the group receiving retrograde aortic catheterization). A control group of 32 patients without aortic valvular stenosis was evaluated as well.

Intervention

The intervention consisted of retrograde passage of the aortic valve for the purpose of obtaining an invasive aortic valve pressure gradient.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measures were acute cerebral embolic events, defined by MRI findings within 48 hours after catheterization (as compared to precatheterization MRI) and by clinical examination.

Main Results

Twenty-two of 101 patients (22%) assigned to retrograde catheterization developed new focal MRI abnormalities consistent with acute cerebral embolic events. Three of these patients (3%) demonstrated clinically apparent neurologic deficits. None of the patients who did not undergo retrograde catheterization — and none of the control patients — had MRI or clinical evidence of cerebral embolism.

A popular saying holds that if one can hear a heart murmur in the middle of a loud and busy emergency department, then by definition the murmur is significant. Whether or not this is actually true, it does capture the frustration emergency physicians feel when trying to diagnose or manage valvular pathologic conditions with familiar yet limited tools. This article focuses on the valve-related issues the emergency physician will face, from the trauma patient with a mechanical valve who may need his or her anticoagulation reversed to the febrile patient with a new murmur.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) — diagnostic testing features detail that on clinical examination, "If the PDA is moderate or large, the presence of a continuous machinery-type murmur, heard best at the left infraclavicular area, and increased pulses are almost diagnostic". When pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is present, "only a systolic murmur may be heard", and "A wide pulse pressure is present when the PDA is large and there is a large left-to-right shunt". In a large ductus with PAH, "the oxygen saturation in the upper and lower extremities may be helpful in diagnosis of a large PDA with right-to-left shunt at the ductal level". The electrocardiogram (ECG) "may be normal if the ductus is small or may show left atrial enlargement and LV hypertrophy" with left-to-right shunt, and "RV hypertrophy may be present if there is PAH". Echocardiography "with color Doppler in the parasternal short-axis view is diagnostic of a PDA", and although Doppler can estimate pressure, "in cases of significant elevation of PVR, echocardiography may not be diagnostic, and cardiac catheterization and angiography may be indicated". Chest x-ray "may or may not show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings", with signs that "may point to the presence of a significant PDA", and calcification suggests rupture risk. During catheterization, it is important to evaluate shunt and PVR, angiography can define ductal anatomy, and "the PDA can be treated in the catheterization laboratory", while "CT scan or MRI of the chest usually are not necessary to diagnose a PDA".

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^112FCmP2]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the aftermath of the Covid19 pandemic and lockdowns, there has been a growing population awaiting transthoracic echocardiograms for potential valvular heart disease. Conducting comprehensive echocardiograms for all individuals may no longer be practical, leading to substantial delays in obtaining the necessary scans. This paper explores an alternative approach, suggesting the consideration of dedicated and shorter scans specifically for patients suspected of having valvular heart disease.

Hypothesis

To address the increasing waiting times and improve heart valve disease detection, the British Heart Valve Society recommends a tiered approach to echocardiograms.

Methods

This approach includes basic/level 1, focused, minimum standard, and disease-specific scans. Urgency recommendations vary, with individuals experiencing exertional chest pain or pre-syncope requiring prompt scanning within 2 weeks, ideally at a valve clinic.

Results

Patients without known valve disease but with a murmur and stable breathlessness should be scanned as soon as possible, within a maximum of 6 weeks, balancing local demand and capacity. For those with an asymptomatic murmur and no prior scan, a basic/level 1 study is recommended to triage the necessity for a minimum standard study. Emphasizing appropriate triage for all requests, the statement guides decisions on the necessity for echocardiography, urgency level, and the required scan type.

Conclusion

This practical Consensus Statement from the British Heart Valve Society aims to support appropriate shorter transthoracic echocardiography for patients referred for suspected valvular heart disease. The goal is to enhance capacity in a secure manner, thereby minimizing the risks associated with delays in obtaining timely scans.

### A systolic murmur is a common presentation of aortic regurgitation detected by echocardiography [^113u4SNP]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The finding of aortic regurgitation at a classical examination is a diastolic murmur.

Hypothesis

Aortic regurgitation is more likely to be associated with a systolic than with a diastolic murmur during routine screening by a noncardiologist physician.

Methods

In all, 243 asymptomatic patients (mean age 42 ± 10 years) with no known cardiac disease but at risk for aortic valve disease due to prior mediastinal irradiation (≥ 35 Gy) underwent auscultation by a noncardiologist followed by echocardiography. A systolic murmur was considered benign if it was grade ≤ II/VI, not holosystolic, was not heard at the apex, did not radiate to the carotids, and was not associated with a diastolic murmur.

Results

Of the patients included, 122 (49%) were male, and 86 (35%) had aortic regurgitation, which was trace in 20 (8%), mild in 52 (21%), and moderate in 14 (6%). A systolic murmur was common in patients with aortic regurgitation, occurring in 12 (86%) with moderate, 26 (50%) with mild, 6 (30%) with trace, and 27 (17%) with no aortic regurgitation (p < 0.0001). The systolic murmurs were classified as benign in 21 (78%) patients with mild and 8 (67%) with moderate aortic regurgitation. Diastolic murmurs were rare, occurring in two (14%) with moderate, two (4%) with mild, and three (2%) with no aortic regurgitation (p = 0.15).

Conclusions

An isolated systolic murmur is a common auscultatory finding by a noncardiologist in patients with moderate or milder aortic regurgitation. A systolic murmur in patients at risk for aortic valve disease should prompt a more thorough physical examination for aortic regurgitation.

Physical examination — auscultated heart sound findings include third heart sound (S3), fourth heart sound (S4), rub, and heart murmur. Third heart sound (S3) is the presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound and fourth heart sound (S4) is the presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound. A rub is an auscultated finding describing high or medium pitched and scratchy sound, generated by inflammation of the pericardial sac. A heart murmur is an auscultated finding describing a series of audible vibrations of varying intensity, frequency, quality, configuration, and duration created by turbulent blood flow in the heart or surrounding vessels. Each of these entries uses permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown.

### Samuel A. levine and the history of grading systolic murmurs [^116AYFBz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Murmurs were described first by Laennec in 1819, after which the significance of a murmur became a matter of debate. By the late 19th century, many physicians regarded systolic murmurs as "organic", whereas others believed that they were often "functional". Samuel Levine became a central figure in separating functional from organic systolic murmurs. Freeman and Levine's 1933 study of 1,000 "noncardiac" subjects determined the frequency, cause, and significance of systolic murmurs. Murmurs were rated on a scale of 1 to 6 grades of intensity. Approximately 20% of their patients had grade 1 or 2 systolic murmurs. Hypertension, fever, tachycardia, and anemia were common factors, and the murmurs were considered functional because they would often disappear when these causes were controlled. Of 19 subjects with grade 3 or 4 murmurs, all were determined to have organic heart disease or anemia. Thus, louder systolic murmurs were found to be a significant finding, as were the cause, location, and effects of posture. They concluded that systolic murmurs often have an explanation and that their grade can be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis. They cautioned that a loud systolic murmur did not necessarily indicate a bad prognosis or even serious heart disease. Levine's system of grading a systolic murmur is valuable and persists into the 21st century.

Tricuspid atresia/single ventricle — presentation and clinical examination note that those with no prior operation or with only a systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt or cavopulmonary shunt can present with cyanosis, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, complete AV block, stroke, worsening exercise ability, bacterial endocarditis, or thromboembolism. Patients who have not had a Fontan operation usually will have cyanosis, clubbing, increased precordial activity, and a single S2; murmurs may include continuous murmurs of aortopulmonary shunts, systolic murmurs of AV valve regurgitation, systolic murmurs of LV or RV outflow obstruction, and diastolic murmurs of semilunar valve regurgitation. Those with ventricular dysfunction may have an S3, jugular venous distention, and hepatomegaly; brachial pulses may be absent on the side of a prior Blalock-Taussig shunt and in the left arm after a subclavian flap procedure for coarctation; scoliosis is common.

ACC/AHA 2008 — Coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAVF) recommendations include class I directives that if a continuous murmur is present, its origin should be defined either by echocardiography, MRI, CT angiography, or cardiac catheterization (Level of Evidence: C); that a large CAVF, regardless of symptomatology, should be closed via either a transcatheter or surgical route after delineation of its course and its potential to fully obliterate the fistula (Level of Evidence: C); and that a small to moderate CAVF in the presence of documented myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, otherwise unexplained ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction or enlargement, or endarteritis should be closed via either a transcatheter or surgical approach after delineation of its course and its potential to fully obliterate the fistula (Level of Evidence: C). A class IIa recommendation states that clinical follow-up with echocardiography every 3 to 5 years can be useful for patients with small, asymptomatic CAVF to exclude development of symptoms or arrhythmias or progression of size or chamber enlargement that might alter management (Level of Evidence: C).

### Heart murmurs in children: evaluation and management [^116erdhe]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Up to 8.6% of infants and 80% of children have a heart murmur during their early years of life. The presence of a murmur can indicate conditions ranging from no discernable pathology to acquired or congenital heart disease. In infants with a murmur, physicians should review the obstetric and family histories to detect the possibility of congenital heart pathologies. Evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist is indicated for newborns with a murmur because studies show that neonatal murmurs have higher rates of pathology than in older children, and neonatal murmur characteristics are more difficult to evaluate during examination; referral is preferred over echocardiography. All infants, with or without a murmur, should have pulse oximetry screening to detect underlying critical congenital heart disease. In older children, most murmurs are innocent and can be followed with serial examinations if there are no findings of concern. Findings in older children that warrant referral include diastolic murmurs, loud or harsh-sounding murmurs, holosystolic murmurs, murmurs that radiate to the back or neck, or signs or symptoms of cardiac disease. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is indicated when a pathologic murmur is suspected. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and other tests should not be reflexively performed as part of all murmur evaluations because these tests can misclassify a murmur as innocent or pathologic, and they are not cost-effective. Emerging technologies include phonocardiography interpretation of murmurs and artificial intelligence algorithms for differentiating innocent from pathologic murmurs.

### Acquired bilateral atrio-ventricular valvular stenosis in a complex single-ventricle physiology following superior cavo-pulmonary connection [^114755xt]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A young female in her early 20s with complex congenital heart disease, previously treated with pulmonary valvotomy and a bidirectional Glenn procedure (for hypoplastic right ventricle, severe pulmonary stenosis and ASD) presented with worsening dyspnoea (NYHA IV), anasarca, fever and cough. Examination revealed atrial fibrillation, hypotension, cyanosis, anasarca and a mid-diastolic murmur. 2D transthoracic echocardiography showed bi-atrial enlargement with thickened mitral and tricuspid valves with severe mitral and tricuspid stenosis. Due to refractory shock despite medical management, mitral and tricuspid valve percutaneous balloon dilation was performed, leading to an improvement in haemodynamics, allowing her to be weaned off support and discharged after 3days.

### An unusual finding in a 57-year-old woman with new onset hypertension and a diastolic murmur [^116qRMWm]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with breathlessness brought on while walking uphill. She had been recently diagnosed with systemic hypertension. There was no known family history of cardiac disease, or prior smoking habit. On examination, pulse was 73bpm and blood pressure 155/73mmHg, which was asymmetrical in her arms. Auscultation revealed a readily audible early diastolic murmur in the aortic area and bilateral subclavian bruits. ECG showed sinus rhythm with no abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular size and function. The ascending aorta was mildly dilated (41mm), with para-aortic thickening noted. Owing to the abnormal appearance of the aortic wall, cardiac MRI, and subsequently 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed (figure 1).

### Diagnosis and management of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure [^114eQwjM]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Diastolic heart failure occurs when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present but left ventricular systolic function is preserved (i.e., ejection fraction greater than 45 percent). The incidence of diastolic heart failure increases with age; therefore, 50 percent of older patients with heart failure may have isolated diastolic dysfunction. With early diagnosis and proper management the prognosis of diastolic dysfunction is more favorable than that of systolic dysfunction. Distinguishing diastolic from systolic heart failure is essential because the optimal therapy for one may aggravate the other. Although diastolic heart failure is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from systolic heart failure, normal ejection fraction and abnormal diastolic function in the presence of symptoms and signs of heart failure confirm diastolic heart failure. The pharmacologic therapies of choice for diastolic heart failure are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and beta blockers.

### Unknown rheumatic cardiac disease as cause of acute onset post-partum dyspnea: a case report [^116FjURx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute post-partum dyspnea configures an obstetric challenge with multiple differential diagnosis.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a previous healthy woman with preeclampsia who developed severe dyspnea 30 h after delivery. She complained of cough, orthopnea, and bilateral lower extremities oedema. She denied headaches, blurry vision, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills. Auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur, and was compatible with pulmonary oedema. A timely bedside echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium with severe mitral insufficiency suggestive of an unknown rheumatic disease. She was managed with noninvasive ventilation, loop diuretics, vasodilators, thromboprophylaxis, head-end elevation, and fluid restriction with progressive improving.

Conclusions

Hemodynamic changes in pregnant patients with previously silent cardiac disease may pose a challenge and cause post-partum dyspnea. This scenario requires a timely and multidisciplinary approach.

Physical examination limits and lesion-specific clues — mitral, aortic, and tricuspid regurgitation: In left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, "patients with LV dysfunction and secondary MR often have very soft murmurs even when the MR is severe", and "it is also important to recognize that even mild degrees of MR… identify patients at considerable risk of heart failure and death in the setting of LV dysfunction and secondary MR". For aortic regurgitation (AR), "the diastolic murmur of AR is often barely audible or may be completely absent, and the only appreciable murmur may be a systolic outflow murmur related to the high SV", with "additional physical findings such as a wide pulse pressure or bounding carotid pulses" suggesting significant AR; "AR is often first identified on echocardiograms performed to investigate a systolic murmur". For tricuspid regurgitation (TR), "TR is also often not identified clinically prior to echocardiography but identified as an important concomitant lesion in patients with MR", and in primary TR, "there are often no clinical manifestations when the TR is mild", whereas "severe TR caused by primary disorders is almost invariably associated with a systolic murmur with respiratory variation, elevated V waves in the jugular venous pulse, and an RV heave as evidence of RV volume overload".

The document calls for studies urgently needed to evaluate newer measures of left ventricular (LV) size, function, and myocardial structure, and notes that LV enlargement and dysfunction are late consequences of valve dysfunction and that as more durable approaches are developed the benefit–risk balance for intervention will shift to earlier in the disease; studies examining earlier markers such as strain and strain-rate imaging, diastolic dysfunction, and circulating blood markers are needed.

Diagnostic testing: changing signs or symptoms in VHD advises action when clinical status evolves; patients with VHD should be instructed to promptly report any change in symptom status, and onset of symptoms or changes on examination should prompt repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate for progressive valve dysfunction, altered ventricular response, or other causes, with access to appropriate clinicians emphasized.

### Expert consensus for multi-modality imaging evaluation of cardiovascular complications of radiotherapy in adults: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^116aC3cS]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Practical use of imaging studies for follow-up evaluation — expert consensus: A pre-treatment cardiovascular screening for risk factors and a careful clinical examination should be performed in all patients, and a baseline comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation is warranted in all patients before initiating the radiotherapy. During follow-up, a yearly history and physical examination is essential, and the development of either new cardiopulmonary symptoms or new suggestive physical examination findings, such as a new murmur, should prompt transthoracic echocardiography. In patients who remain asymptomatic, screening echocardiography 10 years after treatment appears reasonable, with surveillance transthoracic echocardiography performed every 5 years after the initial 10-year echocardiographic screening evaluation. In high-risk asymptomatic patients (documented anterior or left-side chest irradiation with ≥ 1 risk factors for RIHD), a screening echocardiography may be advocated after 5 years; in these patients, the increased risk of coronary events 5–10 years after radiotherapy makes it reasonable to consider non-invasive stress imaging to screen for obstructive CAD, and repeated stress testing can be planned every 5 years.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

When to consider added imaging in suspected pericardial absence — this condition is an exceedingly rare, incidental finding, typically in an asymptomatic often young person, and while diagnosis can be confirmed with clinical imaging modalities, pitfalls and overdiagnoses need to be avoided; the need for dedicated cardiac imaging should be carefully considered in asymptomatic persons because the diagnosis typically has no clinical consequences. Confirmatory testing should be reserved for symptomatic patients or those at risk for complications and only when patients are considered candidates for surgical options, and surgical management is based on small, uncontrolled observations, limiting any definitive recommendations.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — clinical presentation: The most common clinical presentation of PPCM consists of symptoms consistent with LV dysfunction and congestive heart failure, and symptoms may mimic those encountered in normal pregnancy or other cardiopulmonary diseases, contributing to delayed or missed diagnosis. Physical examination may reveal tachycardia, hypertension, mitral regurgitation murmur, ascites, splenomegaly, S3 gallop, jugular venous distention, and late postural hypotension, and LV thrombus with embolic complications including myocardial infarction has been reported. Electrocardiography often shows LV hypertrophy and nonspecific ST–T–wave changes, with sinus tachycardia and normal or low-voltage QRS complexes with inverted T waves also possible.

### Etiology and diagnosis of systolic murmurs in adults [^112pur5r]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether echocardiography can provide insights into the origin of systolic murmurs and the modern value of bedside cardiovascular diagnosis.

Methods

The author examined 376 inpatients and compared their physical findings to transthoracic echocardiography, exploring the associations between echocardiography and systolic murmurs and investigating the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination for pathologic murmurs.

Results

Four echocardiographic variables predict the presence of systolic murmurs: peak aortic velocity (P < .001); mitral regurgitation severity (P < .001); mitral valve E-point velocity (P = 0.09); and absence of pericardial effusion (P = 0.09). When diagnosing murmurs, the most helpful finding is its distribution on the chest wall with respect to the 3(rd) left parasternal space, a landmark that distinguishes murmurs into 6 patterns. The "apical-base" pattern indicates increased aortic velocity (likelihood ratio [LR] 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 6.7–14): a delayed carotid upstroke (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 4.0–11.5); absent S2 (LR 12.7; 95% CI; 5.3–30.4); and humming quality to the murmur (LR 8.5; 95% CI; 4.3–16.5) further increase the probability of aortic valve disease. The "broad apical" murmur pattern suggests significant mitral regurgitation (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 3.9–11.9); and the "left lower sternal" murmur pattern indicates significant tricuspid regurgitation (LR 8.4; 95% CI; 3.5–20.3): additional bedside observations refine these diagnoses. Nonetheless, this study shows that some classic physical findings are no longer accurate, that physical examination cannot reliably distinguish severe aortic stenosis from less severe stenosis, and that classic physical findings, despite having proven value, are absent in many patients with significant cardiac lesions.

Conclusions

In the diagnosis of systolic murmurs, physical examination has limitations but also unappreciated value. A simple system using onomatopoeia and classifying systolic murmurs into 1 of 6 patterns is diagnostically helpful.

### Elevated pulmonary pressure noted on echocardiogram: a simplified approach to next steps [^112ogUGE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

An elevated right ventricular/pulmonary artery systolic pressure suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common finding noted on echocardiography and is considered a marker for poor clinical outcomes, regardless of the cause. Even mild elevation of pulmonary pressure can be considered a modifiable risk factor, informing the trajectory of patients' clinical outcome. Although guidelines have been published detailing diagnostic and management algorithms, this echocardiographic finding is often underappreciated or not acted upon. Hence, patients with PH are often diagnosed in clinical practice when hemodynamic abnormalities are already moderate or severe. This results in delayed initiation of potentially effective therapies, referral to PH centers, and greater patient morbidity and mortality. This mini-review presents a succinct, simplified case-based approach to the "next steps" in the work-up of PH, once elevated pulmonary pressures have been noted on an echocardiogram. Our goal is for clinicians to develop a good overview of diagnostic approach to PH and recognition of high-risk features that may require early referral.

### Continuous machinery murmur in an octogenarian [^112MBRGf]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sinus of valsalva aneurysm is a rare congenital anomaly and usually presents in adolescence to early adulthood. Manifestations are varied, ranging from asymptomatic murmur to sudden death.

Case Report

An elderly male presented with chest pain and machinery murmur, which was confirmed as ruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm on echocardiogram. Emergency surgical repair led to a successful outcome.

Discussion

Review of the literature revealed that this patient is the oldest reported case. Urgent echocardiography and surgical advice are essential. This condition is potentially treatable even in the older age group and the prognosis is good after surgical repair.

### Operationalizing the 2014 ACC / AHA guidelines for valvular heart disease: a guide for clinicians [^114NX8U5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for valvular heart disease were released to help guide the clinician in caring for patients with this ever more prevalent and complex group of diseases and have been instrumental in providing a foundation of knowledge for the management of patients with valvular heart disease. However, there are many caveats in applying the guidelines to individual patients. As clinicians, we wish to outline important aspects to be considered by other clinicians, including the integration of the echocardiogram with the history and physical examination, recognition of discordant data within an echocardiographic examination, and proper interpretation of the cutoff measurements applied to timing of intervention. Decisions regarding management should be individualized to the institution, particularly when recommending early operation for an asymptomatic patient. Finally, all decisions should be individualized to each patient by not only recognizing specific comorbidities, but also understanding the patient's needs and preferences.

Clinical Introduction

A 32-year old man was referred to our institution for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) following detection of an incidental murmur on physical examination before blood donation. He was asymptomatic with no significant medical history. Physical examination revealed dual heart sounds with a grade II/VI systolic murmur heard in the left sternal border. An ECG was in normal sinus rhythm. TTE was performed (figure 1A-C, online supplementary videos 1–4) followed by cardiac CT angiography (CTA) (figure 1D, E).heartjnl;104/15/1307/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) Transthoracic echocardiography, parasternal left ventricular long axis view.

### Teenage heart murmurs [^111e1G25]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The first-time appearance of a murmur in an adolescent can create a substantial amount of anxiety in the parents and the teenager. The appropriate evaluation and diagnosis is very important in decision-making regarding sports participation in this population. Accurate identification of the innocent murmurs can obviate the need for echocardiography. Identification of a pathologic murmur may reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality in critical lesions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This article discusses the physiology and characteristics of different murmurs, and outlines an approach to cardiac murmurs in adolescents.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography appropriate use criteria (AUC) — indications for murmurs, chest pain, and syncope are as follows: Pathologic murmurs and presumably innocent murmurs with other signs, symptoms or findings of cardiovascular disease were found to be Appropriate for an echocardiogram. In pediatrics, chest pain and syncope are generally benign and echocardiography has been shown to be low-yield; specifically, syncope with no other symptoms or signs of cardiac disease has been rated as Appropriate in the adult AUC, but rated as Rarely Appropriate for pediatric patients, albeit with additional qualifiers of a benign family history and a normal ECG. Use of echocardiography as a primary screen versus after pediatric cardiology consultation depends on many factors and needs to be given due consideration on a case-by-case basis, and if more than one indication could apply, clinicians need to use their judgment in picking the scenario that most closely fits the individual patient.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^116BFF45]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Valvular regurgitation grading — integrative assessment and documentation: Characterization of the severity of regurgitant lesions is among the most difficult problems in valvular heart disease, with difficulty related to the lack of a true gold standard and dependence on hemodynamic conditions at the time of evaluation. For CMR, the evaluation involves fewer parameters, is mostly quantitative, but is still influenced by technical and physiologic factors; to mitigate these effects, quantitative internal checks should be employed, and for isolated MR the difference between the LV SV and aortic total forward flow should match the difference between the LV SV and the pulmonary artery total forward flow or RV SV. Thus, an integrative, comprehensive approach is essential, and interpreters must integrate information and disregard outlying data to make a best estimate of severity. The consensus of the writing group is to classify grading into mild, moderate, and severe; "Trace" regurgitation is used when regurgitation is barely detected, is usually physiologic particularly in right heart valves and MV, and may not produce an audible murmur. Because severity may be influenced by hemodynamic conditions, it is essential to record blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm at the time of the study and note the patient's medications whenever possible.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography AUC — indication categories and common referrals state that indications were finalized after incorporating suggestions by external reviewers, rated independently by the panel, and the median score for each indication became the final rating. In general, indications rated as Appropriate included evaluation of new cardiac symptoms or clinical scenarios known to be associated with congenital or acquired heart disease in the pediatric population; Rarely Appropriate indications clustered around broad systemic diseases and family history of conditions not known to be associated with structural or functional abnormalities detectable by echocardiography; and scenarios rated as May Be Appropriate involved uncertainty or required additional clinical information. In the pediatric outpatient setting, chest pain, syncope and murmur are common reasons for referral; the document presumes clinicians determine whether a murmur is innocent before considering echocardiography, and echocardiographic screening for presumably or clearly innocent murmur has been rated as Rarely Appropriate.

### Initial clinical evaluation of cardiac systolic murmurs in the ED by noncardiologists [^113tRtbb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

It is not exactly known how ED physicians perform in evaluating cardiac systolic murmurs. In 203 consecutive medical ED patients with systolic murmur, we compared the initial clinical evaluation, including auscultation, with transthoracic echocardiography. Of the 203 patients, 132 (65%) had innocent murmurs and 71 patients (35%) had valvular heart disease. Sensitivity and specificity of the initial clinical routine evaluation in diagnosing echocardiographic valvular heart disease were 82% (70%-86%) and 69% (60%-76%), respectively. Independent significant positive predictors of valvular heart disease were grade > 2/6 systolic murmur (odds ratio [OR], 8.3; confidence interval, 3.5–19.7, P < .001) and pathologic electrocardiogram (ECG) (OR, 8.4; CI, 3.2–22, P < .001. Patients younger than 50 years with a systolic murmur graded ≤ 2/6 had innocent murmurs in 98%. The initial clinical evaluation, including auscultation, by experienced ED physicians in internal medicine distinguishes well between innocent murmurs and valvular heart disease in medical patients with cardiac systolic murmurs.

Clinically, he was well built with normal vital signs. Cardiac auscultation was significant for a diastolic murmur over the praecordium. An ECG showed non-specific ST changes, and a subsequent transthoracic echocardiography performed revealed diastolic flow from the left ventricular (LV) anteroseptal wall into the LV cavity. A diagnosis of coronary-cameral fistula was confirmed by a multidetector CT which showed a 2.5×2 cm aneurysmal left anterior descending artery fistula to the LV. In addition to starting aspirin, transcatheter closure with occlusion device was considered knowing the potential risk of thrombus formation in the aneurysm and subsequent systemic embolisation.

### Low-grade systolic murmurs in healthy middle-aged individuals: innocent or clinically significant? A 35-year follow-up study of 2014 Norwegian men [^11591RX4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a low-grade systolic murmur, found at heart auscultation, in middle-aged healthy men influences the long-term risk of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Setting and subjects. During 1972–1975, 2014 apparently healthy men aged 40–59years underwent an examination programme including case history, clinical examination, blood tests and a symptom-limited exercise ECG test. Heart auscultation was performed under standardized conditions, and murmurs were graded on a scale from I to VI. No men were found to have grade V/VI murmurs. Participants were followed for up to 35years.

Results

A total of 1541 men had no systolic murmur; 441 had low-grade murmurs (grade I/II) and 32 had moderate-grade murmurs (grade III/IV). Men with low-grade murmurs had a 4.7-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–11.1] increased age-adjusted risk of AVR, but no increase in risk of CVD death. Men with moderate-grade murmurs had an 89.3-fold (95% CI 39.2–211.2) age-adjusted risk of AVR and a 1.5-fold (95% CI 0.8–2.5) age-adjusted increased risk of CVD death.

Conclusions

Low-grade systolic murmur was detected at heart auscultation in 21.9% of apparently healthy middle-aged men. Men with low-grade murmur had an increased risk of AVR, but no increase in risk of CVD death. Only 1.6% of men had moderate-grade murmur; these men had a very high risk of AVR and a 1.5-fold albeit non-significant increase in risk of CVD death.

### Evaluation of children with heart murmurs [^1167QhXY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac murmurs can be a source of anxiety for both physicians and parents until serious cardiac disorders are excluded. The innocent cardiac murmur is still the most common finding in healthy children and can usually be diagnosed through obtaining a complete history and performing a complete physical examination. However, a cardiac murmur may be the first sign of a structural cardiac disease and should not be ignored. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation is required when murmur assessment is not clear and diagnostic uncertainty is present. Educating and reassuring parents remains an important aspect of this evaluation. This article discusses features of innocent and pathological murmurs and provides an approach to cardiac murmurs in children.

### Managing a "New" murmur in healthy children and teens [^1152ZNc8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

An asymptomatic child with a murmur can be challenging practice management conundrum. Some providers refer all patients with a "new" murmur to a cardiologist, likely resulting in excessive resource utilization and parental anxiety. This study examines whether the prevalence of significant cardiac pathology differs in asymptomatic patients aged 2 to 18 years who were referred for a murmur that was "new" versus those referred for a murmur that was known to exist and followed conservatively during the previous 2 years. Of 473 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 33/473 (7.0%) were diagnosed with cardiac pathology, with 21/357 (5.9%) occurring among "new" murmur referrals and 12/116 (10.3%) occurring among "known" murmur referrals. Notably, 34/357 (9.5%) patients referred for a "new" murmur had no murmur present when assessed by the cardiologist. This study suggests that asymptomatic children with a "new" murmur may be conservatively managed. This may lessen health care resource utilization rates and overall parental anxiety.

COR 2a, LOE B-NR: "For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and known coronary stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or middle coronary segment on CCTA, FFR-CT can be useful for diagnosis of vessel-specific ischemia and to guide decision-making regarding the use of coronary revascularization". COR 2a, LOE B-NR: "For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain after an inconclusive or abnormal exercise ECG or stress imaging study, CCTA is reasonable". COR 2a, LOE B-NR: "For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD undergoing stress testing, the addition of CAC testing can be useful".

### Recommendations for cardiac point-of-care ultrasound nomenclature [^117Tvb97]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Nomenclature recommendations — writing group states that it outlines "recommendations for a standardized, pragmatic, and consistent nomenclature to describe different forms of cardiac ultrasound, including 'cardiac POCUS', 'consultative echocardiography', and 'ultrasound-assisted physical examination' ('Central Illustration')".

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with pericardial disease: endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^113xF6Nh]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Congenital absence of the pericardium — general indications for imaging emphasize that the condition "is typically asymptomatic, or the presenting symptoms are nonspecific", so it "is most often suggested or diagnosed by incidental findings on chest x-ray, echocardiography, CT, or CMR". The "need for additional imaging modalities should be considered in the clinical context", and "for an asymptomatic person with suspicion on initial imaging modalities, further evaluation may not be necessary because it will not have therapeutic consequences".

### Polycystic ovary syndrome… [^116VFDTF]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Polycystic ovary syndrome is an inherited disease that affects women of childbearing age. The disorder causes multiple abnormal cysts in enlarged ovaries, so that they do not produce the normal number of eggs and do not ovulate normally. The disease is present at birth but does not cause symptoms until women enter puberty. PCOS occurs in up to 10% of women and is a leading cause of female infertility. Women with PCOS have irregular and infrequent menstrual periods and may develop amenorrhea. Women with PCOS are likely to have high blood pressure, obesity, facial acne, hirsutism, and thinning scalp hair. They also have insulin resistance, which may lead to development of type 2 diabetes.

The February 7, 2007, issue of JAMA includes an article about polycystic ovary syndrome. Diagnosis and testing History of irregular or absent menstrual periods Ultrasound examination of the ovaries. Blood pressure checks Screening for diabetes because women who have PCOS are likely to develop glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes Treatment Treatment of PCOS focuses on the symptoms that occur in each individual. Risk reduction for diabetes and heart disease is important. A number of treatments are available: Weight loss and exercise can help to manage diabetes and high blood pressure and reduce risk of development of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Weight loss and exercise are also crucial to prevent type 2 diabetes. Medications may be prescribed to control blood pressure.

Stopping smoking reduces risk of cardiac disease. Treating type 2 diabetes may involve oral medications and insulin if diet and exercise do not control elevated blood sugar levels. Oral contraceptives regulate menstrual periods and suppress androgen. Metformin, an oral medication often used in treating type 2 diabetes, improves insulin resistance even if diabetes is not yet present, decreases androgen, and improves ovulation. Spironolactone is a diuretic that decreases androgen and treats acne and hirsutism. Mechanical methods help to manage excessive hair growth. Laser treatments and prescription creams may also be prescribed for women with hirsutism. For more information American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologistshttp: //www. acog. org.
