## Question

Management of acute asthma exacerbations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of acute asthma exacerbations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify severity and prioritize immediate stabilization. Then, I should verify first-line therapies and dosing, including SABA, oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids. Next, I will review adjuncts for severe presentations, such as ipratropium, IV magnesium, and heliox, and double-check their evidence. After that, I need to consider escalation to ICU care and ventilatory strategies. Finally, I will confirm disposition criteria, post-exacerbation care, and special populations, and I will reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way with guideline-backed sources.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework and immediate priorities. Exacerbations span mild to life-threatening, and I should not undercall severity because that drives both therapy and disposition; I need to assess symptoms, work of breathing, speech, mental status, oxygen saturation, and objective measures like PEF or FEV1, while remembering that some patients have poor symptom perception and may look deceptively well despite dangerous obstruction, so objective measures matter here [^112MfK2d]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize early recognition and intervention; yes, both GINA and ED-focused reviews stress rapid assessment and timely treatment to prevent deterioration and reduce admissions [^114yaAj6].

> Next, I should review first-line bronchodilation. Frequent inhaled SABA is foundational. The most cost-effective and efficient delivery is pMDI with spacer, and in mild-to-moderate exacerbations, repeating 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes up to three doses is reasonable if needed, with reassessment after each cycle. If there is a good response, I should stop additional SABA to avoid overuse and tachyphylaxis [^117WaQ1z] [^113TEkak]. Wait, let me verify the equivalence of pMDI versus nebulizer; contemporary evidence and guidelines support pMDI with spacer as at least equivalent to nebulized therapy in most settings, which is operationally helpful in busy EDs [^113juTH7].

> I need to ensure oxygen is titrated appropriately. Target SpO2 93–95% in adults and adolescents. Avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia, and continue controlled oxygen while obtaining ABGs in severe cases or when deterioration is suspected, especially if PEF/FEV1 is under 50% predicted or the patient is not responding to initial therapy [^112VhsBR] [^111ez4KU]. Hold on, I should verify that ABG is not delayed unnecessarily; yes, obtain gases promptly in high-risk patients while maintaining oxygenation, as CO2 retention and acidosis change management and triage urgency [^111ez4KU].

> Now, systemic corticosteroids. I should confirm that all but the mildest exacerbations warrant systemic steroids to hasten resolution and reduce relapse. Adults typically receive prednisolone 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days, and children 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/day for 3–5 days, with no routine taper if the course is under two weeks, and dexamethasone can be used in select cases with reassessment for response and relapse risk [^1117x8e1] [^112UTXGN] [^111vyWEz]. Wait, I initially thought dexamethasone was uniformly limited to 1–2 days; let me reconsider — GINA notes dexamethasone may be used in short courses with reassessment, and some protocols use 1–2 days, but the key is to reassess and switch or extend if there is failure of resolution or relapse, so I should not overgeneralize a fixed 1–2 day limit without context [^1121xZVs] [^1179T5GD].

> For moderate-to-severe exacerbations, I should add ipratropium to SABA. Let me verify the benefit signal; GINA recommends adding short-acting muscarinic antagonists in the ED for moderate-to-severe exacerbations to reduce hospitalizations and improve PEF/FEV1, and pediatric evidence syntheses also show reduced admission risk when anticholinergics are added to SABA, which aligns with practice [^117YNbRp] [^1119mi5A]. I should double-check that this applies across ages; yes, benefits are observed in adults, adolescents, and children, supporting broad application in the appropriate severity tier [^117YNbRp].

> In severe or life-threatening presentations, I need to escalate thoughtfully. IV magnesium sulfate is the adjunct with the most consistent signal for reducing hospitalizations and improving lung function; I should administer 2 g IV over 20 minutes in adults, with pediatric dosing of 25–50 mg/kg up to 2 g, ideally early if the patient is not responding to initial inhaled therapy [^1119mi5A] [^115sLYex]. But wait, what about inhaled magnesium? Evidence does not support routine inhaled magnesium, so I should reserve it for research or exceptional contexts rather than routine care [^113nFGzY].

> Heliox can be considered when airflow limitation is severe and standard therapy is failing. I should confirm that the evidence is low-to-moderate; yes, heliox may reduce work of breathing and improve aerosol delivery in select patients, but data are limited and it should not delay definitive airway or ventilatory management if needed [^1119mi5A] [^113nFGzY]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines position heliox as an adjunct rather than a replacement; that is correct, it is supportive therapy in refractory cases [^113nFGzY].

> I will now examine what to avoid. Routine antibiotics are not indicated unless there is strong evidence of bacterial infection such as fever with purulent sputum or radiographic pneumonia; I need to ensure I do not conflate viral-triggered exacerbations with bacterial infection, as most are viral and antibiotics do not improve outcomes in the absence of infection [^116rnTG6] [^113fpqzA]. I should also confirm that IV β-agonists are not recommended routinely; GINA advises insufficient evidence for routine IV β-agonists in severe exacerbations, so I should reserve them for exceptional, monitored scenarios if at all [^114QSgjc]. Finally, methylxanthines like aminophylline have poor efficacy and a worse safety profile compared with modern bronchodilators; they should be avoided in routine ED management [^112jnau7].

> Next, I should review ICU-level care and ventilatory strategy. Intubation is a last resort due to dynamic hyperinflation and barotrauma risks; indications include altered mental status, severe hypoxemia despite maximal oxygen, rising CO2 with acidosis, or impending respiratory arrest, and I should involve critical care early when these emerge [^114XWTeM]. Ventilator settings must minimize auto-PEEP: use low respiratory rates, low tidal volumes, prolonged expiratory time, and permissive hypercapnia as needed; I need to ensure I am not overcorrecting CO2 at the expense of hemodynamics and barotrauma, and I should monitor for hypotension from high intrathoracic pressures [^114XWTeM]. Let me verify adjuncts in the ICU; heliox-driven nebulization and, in select refractory cases, extracorporeal support may be considered in expert centers, but these are exceptions rather than rules [^114XWTeM].

> Disposition should be driven by objective response and risk. I should confirm that safe discharge generally requires sustained improvement in symptoms, normal work of breathing, SpO2 at or above 92–95% on room air, and PEF or FEV1 at 60–80% of personal best or predicted, with a plan for close follow-up and education. Patients with poor response, high-risk features, or unreliable follow-up warrant admission [^115sLYex] [^112HE3BK]. Hold on, I should verify that high-risk features include prior intubation, ICU admission, recent ED visits or hospitalizations, poor adherence or SABA overuse, psychiatric comorbidity, and food allergy; yes, these are consistently flagged for closer monitoring and specialist referral [^11497Yih].

> Post-exacerbation care is critical to prevent relapse. I need to ensure a written asthma action plan, inhaler technique review, trigger assessment, and controller optimization before discharge. Stepping up ICS-containing therapy for 2–4 weeks after a severe exacerbation is reasonable, and follow-up should be arranged within 2–7 days, ideally before stopping oral steroids if prescribed [^111EpqPw] [^111kNbTU] [^111dzYpc]. Let me double-check the emphasis on ICS-containing controllers; GINA and consensus statements strongly discourage SABA-only regimens and support MART or ICS-containing maintenance to reduce future exacerbations and OCS exposure, which I should reinforce during counseling [^112uwgAT] [^112415yg].

> Special populations require tailored approaches. In pregnancy, I should maintain standard acute therapies, recognizing that hypoxemia is more dangerous than most medications; systemic corticosteroids and SABA are considered safe, and magnesium can be used when indicated, with close maternal-fetal monitoring [^114yaAj6]. In young children, I should rely on weight-based dosing, consider spacer devices for all inhaled therapy, and remember that early systemic corticosteroids reduce admissions; for preschool wheeze phenotypes, short-course ICS at viral onset may reduce OCS use and ED visits in selected children, though this does not generalize to all pediatric asthma [^111KPxZK]. In older adults, I need to check for comorbidities, cardiac disease, and medication interactions that may complicate bronchodilator and steroid use, and I should have a lower threshold for admission if response is suboptimal [^114yaAj6].

> I should reconcile areas of controversy transparently. Increasing ICS dose at home at the first sign of worsening has not shown clear benefit in blinded RCTs for mild-to-moderate asthma, yet GINA still recommends ICS-containing reliever strategies and structured action plans. This likely reflects differences in populations, adherence, and reliever choice, so I should individualize advice and emphasize early ICS-formoterol use where appropriate rather than blanket ICS dose-doubling alone [^115mUwa7] [^112uwgAT]. Also, while some protocols cap dexamethasone at 1–2 days, GINA allows short dexamethasone courses with reassessment for relapse, so I should avoid rigid dogma and instead reassess clinically for response and recurrence risk [^1121xZVs] [^1179T5GD].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are complete. I should record severity criteria, treatments given with timing, objective response including PEF/FEV1 trends, and the discharge plan including medications, action plan, and follow-up. I should also flag high-risk patients for expedited specialty referral and consider FENO-guided strategies in maintenance care to reduce future exacerbations, while avoiding FENO for acute severity assessment in the ED given poor correlation and feasibility [^111kNbTU] [^111jDgh2] [^114Hb5jc]. Hold on, I should verify that comprehensive discharge bundles improve outcomes; yes, programs that bundle controller optimization, inhaler technique, and self-management education reduce subsequent ED visits and hospitalizations, which justifies the extra time invested at discharge [^111kNbTU].

Acute asthma exacerbations require **rapid assessment and early intervention** to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent relapse [^114yaAj6]. The cornerstone of management is **short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)** with repeated dosing every 20 minutes for the first hour [^113TEkak], plus early systemic corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and relapse risk [^1117x8e1]. For severe or refractory cases, add **ipratropium** [^117YNbRp], intravenous magnesium sulfate [^1119mi5A], and consider heliox or noninvasive ventilation [^11575Y5q]; avoid routine antibiotics unless infection is confirmed [^116rnTG6]. Monitor lung function, oxygen saturation, and clinical status closely [^112HE3BK], and arrange follow-up with an updated action plan and inhaler technique review to reduce future exacerbations [^111kNbTU].

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

Rapid assessment of **severity and response to therapy** guides escalation and disposition [^112HE3BK]. Severity is classified by symptoms, lung function (PEF/FEV1), and oxygenation:

| **Severity** | **Symptoms** | **PEF/FEV1** | **Oxygen saturation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | Minimal dyspnea, wheezing, or cough | 70–100% predicted or personal best | ≥ 95% |
| Moderate | Increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough | 50–69% predicted | 90–94% |
| Severe | Marked dyspnea, accessory muscle use, speech difficulty | 30–49% predicted | 85–89% |
| Life-threatening | Altered mental status, cyanosis, silent chest | < 30% predicted | < 85% |

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line therapy

- **Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**: First-line for rapid bronchodilation; administer 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour via pMDI with spacer [^113TEkak] or nebulizer [^113juTH7].
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Early administration (within 1 hour) reduces relapse and hospitalization; prednisone 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days in adults [^112UTXGN]; 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days in children [^112UTXGN].

---

### Adjunctive therapies for severe or refractory exacerbations

- **Ipratropium bromide**: Add to SABA for moderate-to-severe cases to reduce hospitalizations and improve lung function [^117YNbRp].
- **Intravenous magnesium sulfate**: 2 g IV over 20 minutes for severe or refractory cases; reduces hospitalizations and improves lung function [^113juTH7].
- **Heliox**: Consider for severe airway obstruction not responding to standard therapy [^1119mi5A].
- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: Use for severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures include **oxygen therapy** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 93% [^112VhsBR] and **patient education** with a written asthma action plan and inhaler technique review to improve adherence and reduce future exacerbations [^111kNbTU].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring should track **lung function, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate, and mental status** [^112HE3BK]. Reassess at 1 hour and at intervals until a clear response or a plateau is reached [^113GzsoZ].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for any **life-threatening exacerbation** or for severe features such as PEF/FEV1 < 50%, SpO2 < 90%, or marked accessory muscle use. Admission is also warranted for failure to respond after initial therapy, high-risk patients (e.g. prior intubation, ICU admission, or recent ED visits), or when reliable follow-up is uncertain [^112HE3BK].

---

## Discharge planning and follow-up care

Discharge planning should include **prescribing controller therapy** (ICS or ICS-LABA) and arranging follow-up within 2–7 days [^111EpqPw]. Provide a written asthma action plan and reinforce inhaler technique to reduce relapse risk [^111kNbTU].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pediatric patients**, who generally receive the same therapies with weight-based dosing and close monitoring [^112UTXGN], and **pregnant patients**, for whom standard therapies are safe and should be used to maintain adequate oxygenation [^notfound].

---

## Common pitfalls and errors

Common pitfalls include **delayed administration of systemic corticosteroids**, underuse of ipratropium or magnesium in severe cases, and overuse of antibiotics without confirmed infection [^116rnTG6]. Additional errors include inadequate monitoring, premature discharge, and poor patient education or follow-up planning [^111kNbTU].

---

Effective management of acute asthma exacerbations centers on **early SABA and systemic corticosteroids**, with escalation for severe disease and structured follow-up to prevent recurrence [^112h47vp].

### Inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers in the acute treatment of asthma exacerbations [^112DWuMk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation has a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and constitutes a challenging condition for primary health-care providers. Severe exacerbations are also an important cause of hospital admissions and require high costs. Despite this, a widely accepted definition is still lacking; etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms are still incompletely defined. Although the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene modifiers in preventing mild to moderate asthma exacerbation is well recognized, their role within the context of an asthma action plan in general practice and in home-based early intervention for acute exacerbations is still controversial. Although systemic corticosteroids (CS) are standard care for severe exacerbation in the emergency department's (ED) management of asthma, published evidence suggests that high doses of ICS may be beneficial in the ED. The additive benefit of ICS when used with systemic CS is still debated. Data on leukotriene modifiers in the management of asthma exacerbation are limited. However, therapeutic strategies of this emergency including ICS and leukotriene modifiers seem logical and may be suitable, at least in certain patient groups. The availability of different drugs, active on different targets, can potentially contribute to a better management of asthma exacerbations.

Actively Address Asthma Exacerbation Management and Prevention

Best Practice Advice 5: Recognize the cumulative adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use and work to avoid their overuse by preventing future exacerbations

While some asthma exacerbations may require SCS, earlier recognition and use of ICS with SABA or fast-acting LABA for quick relief or early in an exacerbation may mitigate the need for SCS. Rarely, if ever, are SCS required for effective maintenance management, and their use should be minimized where possible due to potential short-term and long-term adverse effects.

Adverse effects resulting from SCS use occur based on cumulative lifetime dose, starting at doses as low as 500 mg of prednisone or equivalent and less than 30 days of exposure. Adverse effects of SCS can occur with both chronic and repeated episodic use with cumulative doses ≥ 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent per year, regardless of the length of treatment. A common regimen for exacerbation management is prednisone (or equivalent) 40–60 mg for 5–10 days, adding up to a cumulative dose of 200–600 mg per exacerbation, approaching or exceeding the long-term effect risk threshold after even a single course of SCS. Higher cumulative SCS doses are associated with increases in cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, fractures, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, kidney impairment, cataracts, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain –.

To limit the use of SCS, PCCs can implement asthma treatment that appropriately uses ICS-based therapies in both acute and maintenance regimens, thereby reducing the risk of exacerbations and the need for SCS. PCCs should include monitoring patients for adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially among those with multiple courses of SCS therapy over the years of their asthma care.

Introduction

Asthma exacerbations (also referred to as "flare-ups" or "attacks") are characterized by a sudden or progressive worsening of symptoms including wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, and decline in lung function. These are an alteration from the patient's usual condition, necessitating a change in therapy. Asthma exacerbations are a significant cause of disease-related morbidity, and mortality, progressive loss of lung function, and increased health care costs globally. Some data over the past decades show reductions in age-adjusted asthma mortality, while asthma incidence remains steady or slightly increased (Fig. 1). Asthma exacerbation rate data are inconsistent, with some showing increased exacerbations and some showing decreased exacerbations in recent years, but emergency department (ED) visits for asthma remain a significant challenge. Further, asthma exacerbations may be underreported as they are not always medically treated or reported.

Primary care clinicians (PCCs) play an integral role in preventing and managing asthma exacerbations and most patients can be successfully managed in primary care worldwide. Enhancing prevention and management of asthma exacerbations in primary care settings would be expected to further lower asthma morbidity and potentially mortality. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report includes an algorithm for exacerbation recognition and management in primary care, which can facilitate implementation of practical step-by-step strategies to deal with exacerbations (Fig. 2).

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^111smUFA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Future research priorities in acute exacerbations: "Although exacerbations of asthma are a very common problem, there is a surprising paucity of data regarding intervention in this situation". "Further research is desperately needed in children and adults". Study design "should consider the potential impact of the dose, timing and frequency of escalation of the intervention, and the population being studied". Moreover, "it is imperative that further research be undertaken to better define early predictors of asthma exacerbations (including markers of inflammation) and strategies to prevent airway remodeling".

### The yellow zone in asthma treatment: is it a gray zone? [^116Ewj7E]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on methods of preventing and minimizing exacerbations and to target problems for improvement.

Data Sources

PubMed and Cochrane Review searches of the English-language literature using the following key yellow zone terms: asthma exacerbation, self-management plans, inhaled corticosteroids, and acute management of asthma exacerbations.

Study Selection

Articles relevant to our yellow zone intervention inquiry.

Results

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines advocate that physicians give patients written action plans with instructions on managing home (yellow zone) exacerbations. However, the criteria used to identify the yellow zone are ambiguous and often confusing to patients and physicians. In addition, apart from a passing mention that doubling doses of inhaled corticosteroids may be an option in asthma step-up care, the guidelines contain no recommendations for yellow zone treatment strategies. This deficiency is directly related to the paucity of organized evidence on the efficacy of the various pharmacological interventions that can be used during an exacerbation.

Conclusions

Translating the NIH guidelines into realistic clinical practice requires a clearer and more patient-friendly definition of the yellow zone, and this improved definition will facilitate the prescription of effective interventions in the management of yellow zone exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Asthma diagnosis and management [^114Rsq7P]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). This article provides an evidence-based review of diagnosis and management of asthma. Early recognition of asthma exacerbations and initiation of treatment are essential. Treatment is dictated by the severity of the exacerbation. Treatment involves bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Other treatment modalities including magnesium, heliox, and noninvasive ventilator support are discussed. Safe disposition from the ED can be considered after stabilization of the exacerbation, response to treatment and attaining peak flow measures.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Inpatient management of an acute asthma exacerbation using clinical care pathways [^116zNU66]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations remain a leading cause of hospitalization in the pediatric population, and many children who require hospitalization for status asthmaticus are managed using clinical care pathways (CPGs). Clinical care pathways are often created or adopted by healthcare systems in order to establish specific, evidence-based guidelines that standardize and coordinate quality care in both the emergency room and inpatient settings. This paper reviews the use of these guidelines and the updated evidence-based recommendations regarding best-practice for acute asthma care of hospitalized children, including the 2020 recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel (NAEPP).

Best Practice Advice 2: Counsel patients on the warning signs and symptoms of loss of asthma control that may precede exacerbations to facilitate initiation of timely and effective treatment to prevent exacerbations or reduce their severity

Counseling patient on warning signs such as an increase in their usual asthma symptoms or new onset of things such as cough that can precede exacerbations could prompt treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy, help mitigate exacerbation severity, and potentially prevent an exacerbation from occurring. Appropriate use of anti-inflammatory therapy (ICS) prior to an exacerbation may decrease use and overuse of health care resources such as the ED or urgent care, SABA and systemic corticosteroids (SCS).

Using an asthma action plan can give patients and families specific parameters for patients to take action in identifying and using early treatment for an exacerbation. Exacerbation triggers and how to address them should be identified.

While spirometry is the gold standard for diagnosing asthma it has limited practical value in exacerbation management. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement can provide objective data on lung function for assessing exacerbation severity and response to treatment. However, frequency and severity of symptoms is a more practical and widely available measure of exacerbation onset and is more sensitive than PEF for most people. For those with poor perception of airflow limitation symptoms, regular PEF monitoring can help proactively identify exacerbation episodes.

Window of opportunity for intervention

About 10–14 days before an asthma exacerbation, progressively rising inflammation often underlies the decrease in lung function (PEF), accompanied by an increase in symptoms, which may result in patients increasing SABA use –. SABA use can provide symptomatic relief, but it does not address airway inflammation and overuse of SABA has been shown to increase risks. The timeframe leading up to an exacerbation may represent a "window of opportunity" to minimize airway inflammation and either prevent or reduce the exacerbation by adding anti-inflammatory therapy, if the patient is not using anti-inflammatory therapy, or scaling up the current anti-inflammatory dose.

GINA recommends the use of an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR), which is low dose as-needed ICS-formoterol, or ICS-SABA for symptom control rather than SABA-only as a means to improve control and mitigate the risk of a serious exacerbation. Formoterol has the advantage of a fast and long-acting bronchodilator, while salbutamol (albuterol) is also fast but short-acting.

### Long-acting beta (2)-agonists in the management of asthma exacerbations [^116Ly2C4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Although long-acting beta2-agonists have a defined role in maintenance therapy, their potential use in exacerbations remains largely undetermined. This paper reviews recent literature on long-acting beta2-agonists in the context of the management of acute asthma.

Recent Findings

Although clinical experience with long-acting beta2-agonists now approaches 20 years, their applicability in asthma exacerbations has only recently been explored. Formoterol, with a rapid onset of action similar to albuterol, has already been approved in Europe as a reliever medication and there are emerging data to support its use in the outpatient management of mild exacerbations of asthma. Salmeterol added to conventional therapy has been found to be safe and potentially beneficial in patients hospitalized for an exacerbation.

Summary

Long-acting beta2-agonists have proved to be useful in the chronic management of asthma and the prevention of exacerbations. Recent data suggest a role for patient-guided management using adjustable dosing of long-acting beta2-agonists with inhaled corticosteroids during periods of worsening asthma. Further research to evaluate the potential role of long-acting beta2-agonists in the management of acute asthma is needed.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having asthma exacerbations characterized by worsening symptoms, airflow obstruction, and an increased requirement for rescue bronchodilators. The goals of managing an asthma exacerbation are prompt recognition and rapid reversal of airflow obstruction to avert relapses and future episodes. Short-acting beta-agonists, oxygen, and corticosteroids form the basis of management of acute asthma exacerbation, but a role is emerging for anticholinergics and newer agents such as levalbuterol and formoterol. Initiation or intensification of long-term controller therapy, treatment of comorbid conditions, avoidance of likely triggers, and timely follow-up care prevent setbacks. Acceptance of current treatment guidelines by physicians and adherence to the recommended clinical regimens by patients are essential for effective management of asthma. The physician should strive to establish a constructive relationship with the patient by addressing the patient's concerns, reaching agreement on the goals of therapy, and developing a written action plan for patient self-management.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113q9nZJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes.

The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (eg, asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (eg, asthma symptoms), even though validated outcome instruments were not used in studies or were not available. In this example, the Expert Panel confirmed asthma symptoms as an important outcome based on responses from the focus groups. The Expert Panel then used data on this important outcome to create the evidence profiles and EtD tables for the intervention, based on the available evidence.

After prioritizing the outcomes, the Expert Panel used established thresholds for determining significant improvement, also known as the minimally important difference (MID), for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures. These MID criteria are listed in Table IB. – For outcomes with no MID established in the literature, such as exacerbations, the Expert Panel reached consensuson clinically important differences that were based in part on a review of effect sizes in RCTs in the literature and on their judgments regarding the clinical relevance of a given change. In keeping with the recommendations from the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012), treatment with systemic (oral and parenteral) corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were included as core outcome measures for exacerbations. The Expert Panel also included studies that used composite measures of systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114zsRLf]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids for acute asthma… [^114AAQ3U]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does patient-initiated home management of asthma exacerbations with increased doses of inhaled corticosteroids reduce the need for further intervention compared with a daily maintenance dosage of an ICS among children and adults with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Evidence-Based Answer In this Cochrane review, patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma and symptoms consistent with an acute asthma exacerbation who are treated with increased doses of ICSs show no reduction in the need for further intervention with primarily systemic corticosteroids vs. patients treated with stable doses of ICSs. Similarly, increased doses of ICSs do not reduce unscheduled visits to physicians, acute care facilities, or emergency departments or hospital admissions compared with stable doses of ICSs.

1.

2, 3 Early recognition and management of asthma exacerbations are essential in reducing morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with asthma. Asthma action plans, which are written, patient-initiated, home management guidelines that describe maintenance therapy and steps for treatment escalation during an exacerbation, decrease the severity and duration of asthma exacerbations. 1 ICSs are a mainstay of asthma action plans, and the Global Initiative for Asthma guideline recommends increased ICS dosing during an asthma exacerbation.
4. The authors of the Cochrane review sought to determine the safety and effectiveness of increased ICS dosing as part of patient-initiated home management in children and adults with mild to moderate persistent asthma.

Among children and adults with mild to moderate persistent asthma, action plans that instructed patients to increase their ICS dose at the onset of worsening asthma symptoms did not reduce asthma exacerbation severity or duration and, therefore, did not reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids. Unscheduled physician visits, visits to the emergency department, and hospitalizations were not reduced. Secondary outcomes, including serious and nonserious adverse events associated with increased ICS dosing, could not be included or excluded due to a lack of clinical significance. 6 This review had several challenges, including the absence of a placebo control group, recruitment of a population not taking maintenance ICS, and a design that compared the relative effectiveness of two dosages of ICS as maintenance therapy. Further research is necessary.

Although the results of this Cochrane review suggest the use of stable ICS dosing during an exacerbation among patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma, the GINA guideline recommends increasing ICS use as part of patient-initiated asthma action plans during an acute exacerbation.

### Real-world effectiveness of antibiotics in addition to oral corticosteroids for managing asthma exacerbations in adults [^116xgxj3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

There remains a need for real-world studies to gain insight into the short- and long-term effectiveness of add-on antibiotics to guide their appropriate use, as existing evidence for add-on antibiotics in managing acute asthma exacerbations is contradictory. Its indications and benefits remain poorly documented, particularly in primary care settings. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the added value of antibiotic treatment alongside OCSs for managing acute asthma exacerbations among adults.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^11241dzt]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and COPD are the most common chronic respiratory diseases in the world, affecting approximately 20 million and 14 million US adults, respectively. – Each year, hundreds of thousands of asthma and COPD exacerbations require hospitalization, of which an estimated 10% to 19% are managed in the ICU. Severe exacerbations requiring the ICU are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with rates as high as 25% to 30% among patients with COPD. – Despite being distinct diseases, overlap exists regarding pathophysiologic features, presentation of acute exacerbations, and management of asthma and COPD among adult patients who are critically ill. This CHEST Critical Care Review examines the diagnosis and management of patients who are critically ill with these common conditions.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

Management of Worsening Asthma and Exacerbations

Asthma exacerbations represent acute or subacute worsening in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status. In some cases, a patient may present for the first time during an exacerbation.

For discussion with patients, use terminology that is easily understood; "flare-up" is more patient-friendly than the academic term "exacerbation". The terms "episodes", "attacks" and "acute asthma" are often used, but their meanings vary widely.

Preventing severe exacerbations that require treatment with systemic corticosteroids is an important goal of asthma management. Even a single OCS course has significant adverse effects, and taking as few as 4–5 courses of OCS over 7 years' follow-up is associated with increased risk of serious long-term conditions, including osteoporosis, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, cataracts, renal impairment, diabetes, and weight gain. Key strategies for reducing exacerbations include ICS-containing treatment (particularly as-needed-only ICS–formoterol and MART), managing risk factors, and providing a personalized written asthma action plan. The reduction in asthma exacerbations seen in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that public health measures to reduce spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections (e.g. handwashing, social/physical distancing, mask-wearing) may be important in reducing transmission of other respiratory viruses.

Patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and reviewed more frequently. Factors include a history of requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, having a hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit for asthma in the previous year, not currently using or poorly adherent with ICS-containing therapy, overuse of SABAs, a history of psychiatric disease or psychosocial problems, concomitant food allergy, and currently using or having recently stopped OCS (a marker of exacerbation severity) (Box 4–1 in Reference).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HE3BK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MfK2d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of exacerbations — exacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status, and the decrease in expiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with the patient's previous lung function or predicted values; in the acute setting, these measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms, although the frequency of symptoms may be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF; consider the possibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough; a minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a change in symptoms, especially affecting patients with a history of near-fatal asthma and appearing to be more common in males, and regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients; severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment and close monitoring, and patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.

### Practical management of acute asthma in adults [^11575Y5q]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

All asthma patients are at risk for acute asthma exacerbations. Moderate to severe exacerbations account for many emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations each year. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this review is to provide practical guidance in the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma in the hospital setting. Managing patients with acute asthma involves assessing the severity of the exacerbation, implementing measures to rapidly reverse airflow limitation, and instituting therapies that limit the progression of airway inflammation. Some patients may benefit from other supportive measures such as heliox and noninvasive ventilation. If the patient continues to deteriorate and requires mechanical ventilation, then ventilator settings that minimize the risk of hyperinflation should be chosen. After an episode of acute asthma, long-term preventive medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be prescribed and education should be provided to prevent future episodes.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^112415yg]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians play a key role in asthma and asthma exacerbation management worldwide because most patients with asthma are treated in primary care settings. The high burden of asthma exacerbations persists and important practice gaps remain, despite continual advances in asthma care. Lack of primary care-specific guidance, uncontrolled asthma, incomplete assessment of exacerbation and asthma control history, and reliance on systemic corticosteroids or short-acting beta 2 -agonist-only therapy are challenges clinicians face today with asthma care. Evidence supports the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) + fast-acting bronchodilator treatments when used as needed in response to symptoms to improve asthma control and reduce rates of exacerbations, and the symptoms that occur leading up to an asthma exacerbation provide a window of opportunity to intervene with ICS. Incorporating patient perspectives and preferences when designing asthma regimens will help patients be more engaged in their therapy and may contribute to improved adherence and outcomes. This expert consensus contains 10 Best Practice Advice Points from a panel of primary care clinicians and a patient representative, formed in collaboration with the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG), a clinically led charitable organization that works locally and globally in primary care to improve respiratory health. The panel met virtually and developed a series of best practice statements, which were drafted and subsequently voted on to obtain consensus. Primary care clinicians globally are encouraged to review and adapt these best practice advice points on preventing and managing asthma exacerbations to their local practice patterns to enhance asthma care within their practice.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114XWTeM]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe, life-threatening asthma and COPD exacerbations are managed commonly in the ICU and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the commonalities and differences in the diagnosis and management of these obstructive lung diseases to improve patient outcomes via evidence-based care. In this review, we first outline triggers of acute asthma and COPD exacerbations and an initial diagnostic evaluation and severity assessment. We then review the pathophysiologic features of asthma and COPD exacerbations and create a framework for the management of exacerbations in critically ill adult patients aimed at reducing airway inflammation, reversing bronchospasm, and, in severe cases, supporting patients with mechanical ventilation or advanced therapies until clinical improvement is achieved.

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^113nFGzY]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

---

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^113juTH7]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### A review of the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma [^111TjPaE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids (CSs) are generally accepted as treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. In contrast, inhaled corticosteroids (ICs) have been used for the long-term management of asthma but are not widely accepted for the treatment of asthma exacerbations. The onset of action of ICs in acute asthma begins in 1 hour. In patients with mild to moderate exacerbation, administration of high-dose ICs may decrease the need for hospital admission and the number of symptomatic days.

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^115ydVhU]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 13 can be found in EtD Table XIX in Appendix B.

Two blinded RCTs (N = 5481) compared SMART to higher-dose ICS-LABA, in individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. SMART reduced the RR by 25% for exacerbations (high certainty of evidence). SMART also resulted in statistically significant reductions in corticosteroid use but had no significant effect on asthma quality of life or asthma control. As a result, the recommendation was conditional.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^112h47vp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^115sLYex]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

Follow-up

Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, regardless of where it was managed:

- Review the patient's symptom control and risk factors for further exacerbations.
- Prescribe/continue ICS-containing controller therapy (preferably MART with ICS–formoterol) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. If already taking controller therapy, continue increased doses for 2–4 weeks.
- Provide a written asthma action plan and, where relevant, advice about avoiding exacerbation triggers.
- Check inhaler technique and adherence.

Asthma outcomes after an ED presentation for acute asthma are significantly improved by comprehensive intervention programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education (self-monitoring, written action plan, and regular review).

Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma or who have repeat presentations to acute care settings. Follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent ED visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

Asthma management — fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) monitoring evidence summary — In the Expert Panel's judgment, the benefit of FENO monitoring is moderate, with FENO testing associated with a meaningful decrease in exacerbations, whereas the average benefit for asthma control and quality of life did not achieve the minimal clinically important difference and the certainty of evidence for these measures is low; for exacerbations defined as a composite end point, the certainty of evidence is high and the composite end point was defined as any of the following: unscheduled visits to the provider's office, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, oral corticosteroid use, reductions in FEV1 or peak expiratory flow, symptom-associated lung function decline, or Global Initiative for Asthma guideline definitions; studies comparing management strategies that include FENO monitoring with those that do not include 6 RCTs in 1536 adults (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.86) and 7 RCTs in 733 children (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.82), with adults showing an absolute risk reduction of 71 exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 108 to 25 fewer exacerbations) and children showing 116 fewer exacerbations per 1000; when exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids are used, based on 10 RCTs in 1664 adults and children the certainty of evidence is moderate with OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.90 and an absolute risk difference of 67 fewer exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 104 to 19 fewer exacerbations); for exacerbations resulting in hospitalization, 9 RCTs in 1598 adults and children show OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32–1.55 and an absolute risk difference of 11 fewer exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 25 fewer to 19 more exacerbations); no evidence-based FENO cutoff points are available and the Expert Panel has not provided an algorithm to use for this purpose.

### Asthma exacerbations. 5: assessment and management of severe asthma in adults in hospital [^113KwSff]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

It is difficult to understand why there is such a huge discrepancy between the management of severe asthma recommended by evidence-based guidelines and that observed in clinical practice. The recommendations are relatively straightforward and have been widely promoted both in guidelines and reviews. Specialist physicians need to be more proactive in their implementation of such guidelines through the use of locally derived protocols and assessment sheets, reinforced by audit. The common occurrence of severe asthma and its considerable burden to the community would support such an approach.

### Asthma in adults [^111xj3A3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild-to-moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic asthma? What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions. For acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, and short-acting intravenous); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (intravenous and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Acute asthma exacerbations… [^111KPxZK]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Inhaled Corticosteroids INTERMITTENT ASTHMA GINA recommends treating patients with mild intermittent asthma with as-needed inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting beta. PERSISTENT ASTHMA For patients with mild persistent asthma, the Focused Updates recommend either of the following: daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS with SABA for worsening asthma. For mild to moderate persistent asthma, single maintenance and reliever therapy is preferred. This approach reduces the potential adverse effects of chronic steroid use, lowers emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and simplifies patients' medication regimens. 5 GINA recommends daily moderate-dose ICS or ICS/long-acting beta 2 agonist with as-needed ICS/formoterol as equivalent options; however, the Focused Updates panel found the evidence for ICS/formoterol daily and as-needed to be more compelling.

ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS The use of ICS for acute asthma without the concomitant use of oral steroids was previously discouraged. However, for patients from birth to four years of age with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections only and no wheezing between infections, the Focused Updates now conditionally recommend a short course of ICS at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection with an inhaled SABA as needed. 5 This strategy lowers the use of systemic steroids and lowers the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The Focused Updates and the GINA guidelines do not address patients who do well most of the year but have flare-ups that require intervention during certain situations or seasons. SMART may be a useful approach for these patients and lowers the overall use of steroids vs. year-round treatment with ICS/LABA.

The choice to use SMART or a traditional oral steroid burst depends on how accurately patients can perceive symptoms and successfully use multiple doses of ICS/formoterol daily. The cost is also a factor. Allergen Mitigation For patients with asthma who are exposed and allergic to a specific indoor substance, the use of multiple strategies to reduce allergen exposure is conditionally recommended. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is conditionally recommended as an adjunct treatment for patients with mild to moderate allergic asthma who have demonstrated allergic sensitization and evidence of worsening asthma symptoms after exposure. However, unlike GINA, the panel's evidence review did not support using sublingual immunotherapy to treat allergic asthma.

Asthma exacerbation terminology — the academic term 'exacerbation' is commonly used in scientific and clinical literature, although hospital-based studies more often refer to 'acute severe asthma'; however, the term 'exacerbation' is not suitable for use in clinical practice as it is difficult for many patients to pronounce and remember; the term 'flare-up' is simpler and conveys the sense that asthma is present even when symptoms are absent; the term 'attack' is used by many patients and healthcare providers but with widely varying meanings and may not be perceived as including gradual worsening; and in pediatric literature the term 'episode' is commonly used, but understanding of this term by parent/caregivers is not known.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Asthma evaluation and management [^114V2FDA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Exacerbations of severe asthma [^116fDXVV]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Exacerbations occur frequently in severe asthma. They result in significant morbidity and can lead to hospitalization and death. Severe exacerbations can also lead to an accelerated decline in lung function. Phenotyping severe asthma can aid with both prognostication of exacerbation risk and maintenance treatment selection to minimize future risks of exacerbations in severe asthma. The rate of exacerbations differs by phenotype, and is most frequent in refractory eosinophilic asthma and early onset allergic asthma. Phenotype specific therapy can reduce exacerbations in both these forms of severe asthma. Exacerbations are multi-component events. Each exacerbation represents an opportunity to assess and target treatment to the domains of airway pharmacotherapy, self-management behaviour, risk factors, and relevant co-morbidities.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^113fCEr7]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Acute severe asthma: recent advances [^113mjD3j]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute severe asthma is challenging to the clinician both in terms of recognition and appropriate treatment. About 30% of these episodes need admission to the medical intensive care unit with a mortality of 8%. Relapse rates vary from 7 to 15% depending on how well the patient is managed. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in identification of risk factors, pathophysiology and management of acute severe asthma.

Recent Findings

Although the exact mechanism for acute severe asthma is unclear, some that are implicated include inflammation, airway remodeling and downregulation of beta-receptors. None of the environmental factors have been clearly related to the development of near fatal attacks. Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with severe asthma. Lack of steroid responsiveness has been linked to severe asthma attacks. Chemokines and basement membrane changes characteristic of severe asthma are reported in a few studies. Lack of symptom perception in a certain group of patients with acute severe asthma leads to delayed interventions. Specific treatment modalities and ventilator management is reviewed.

Summary

Severe asthma is a phenotype of asthma with variable pathology and clinical presentation. Early recognition and timely intervention is needed to prevent significant mortality and morbidity.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^114yaAj6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### Can measures of small airway dysfunction aid with the diagnosis or management of asthma exacerbations? A systematic review [^115n7znW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Physiological tests for small airway function are feasible in diagnosing acute asthma exacerbations and have been shown to differ in asthmatic patients compared with healthy individuals and at exacerbation and on recovery. However, the lack of robust reference ranges and the heterogeneity of testing methods complicate their clinical application. Further studies are needed to evaluate small airway function specifically during acute asthma exacerbations, particularly in the early stages of the condition. Larger studies are also necessary to assess the impact of demographic factors and comorbidities, such as obesity or allergic rhinitis, on these tests. This systematic review of current literature indicates that these tests may hold promise for future diagnostic criteria in acute asthma exacerbations, but more research is required before they can be routinely integrated into clinical practice.

### Acute asthma in adults: a review [^114WYiG4]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having exacerbations. Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits account for a large proportion of the health-care cost burden of asthma, and avoidance or proper management of acute asthma (AA) episodes represent an area with the potential for large reductions in health-care costs. The severity of exacerbations may range from mild to life threatening, and mortality is most often associated with failure to appreciate the severity of the exacerbation, resulting in inadequate emergency treatment and delay in referring to hospital. This review describes the epidemiology, costs, pathophysiology, mortality, and management of adult AA in the ED and in the ICU.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^1162pdRK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Identify and Assess Asthma Exacerbations

Best Practice Advice 1: Consider incorporating available validated tools into primary care settings to evaluate asthma status including symptom burden, exacerbation history, and risk

Assessing asthma control is fundamental for asthma management to optimize medication therapy, prevent exacerbations, improve quality of life and achieve patient and clinical treatment goals. Clinicians' and patients' assessment of asthma control tends to overestimate control and often differ from each other. Validated tools can help improve the accuracy of assessment of asthma control. However, most validated tools assess only symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness or pain) with little or no attention to past exacerbations and therefore the risk of exacerbations (also called "asthma attacks") which is also a key factor in a patient's overall asthma control.

An ideal tool for assessing asthma control should include questions that reveal both symptoms and exacerbation risk, such as the Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire (AIRQ). Prior exacerbations are the best predictor of future exacerbations, which is one reason the AIRQ contains questions focusing on exacerbation history.

### Core outcomes and factors influencing the experience of care for children with severe acute exacerbations of asthma: a qualitative study [^116jzaTQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Management of acute severe asthma exacerbations in children in the emergency department (ED) is complicated by a variety of possible treatment options, significant variation in practice, and little evidence to support the use of one particular medication over another. The Paediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) asthma working group was formed in 2017. It aims to gather the input of patients, families and clinicians to develop a global consensus on outcome measures and create international guidelines for the conduct and reporting of clinical trials of therapies for acute asthma exacerbations in children.

The currently available asthma literature does not include outcomes prioritised by patients and families, and little is known about what is important to them. Further, although asthma affects children across the globe, most research has been conducted in high-income countries. We conducted an international qualitative study to address this gap.

Qualitative methods are recommended to identify outcomes important to stakeholders, help understand why these outcomes are important and identify appropriate language to use when presenting these outcomes in later surveys. Our findings will inform the development of a planned Delphi survey, which aims to achieve consensus on a core outcome set (COS) of clinical trial measures for these patients.

The specific objectives of this study were to determine parent and caregiver opinions on: (1) the patient and family experience of treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation; (2) and which clinical outcomes are the most important to patients and families.

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^115WE8dQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (SABAs), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer frequent inhaled short-acting β-agonists (such as salbutamol or albuterol) in patients presenting with acute asthma. Recognize that the most cost-effective and efficient delivery is by pressurized metered-dose inhalers with a spacer.

### EAACI position statement on asthma exacerbations and severe asthma [^116uWF8v]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations and severe asthma are linked with high morbidity, significant mortality and high treatment costs. Recurrent asthma exacerbations cause a decline in lung function and, in childhood, are linked to development of persistent asthma. This position paper, from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, highlights the shortcomings of current treatment guidelines for patients suffering from frequent asthma exacerbations and those with difficult-to-treat asthma and severe treatment-resistant asthma. It reviews current evidence that supports a call for increased awareness of (i) the seriousness of asthma exacerbations and (ii) the need for novel treatment strategies in specific forms of severe treatment-resistant asthma. There is strong evidence linking asthma exacerbations with viral airway infection and underlying deficiencies in innate immunity and evidence of a synergism between viral infection and allergic mechanisms in increasing risk of exacerbations. Nonadherence to prescribed medication has been identified as a common clinical problem amongst adults and children with difficult-to-control asthma. Appropriate diagnosis, assessment of adherence and other potentially modifiable factors (such as passive or active smoking, ongoing allergen exposure, psychosocial factors) have to be a priority in clinical assessment of all patients with difficult-to-control asthma. Further studies with improved designs and new diagnostic tools are needed to properly characterize (i) the pathophysiology and risk of asthma exacerbations, and (ii) the clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity of severe asthma.

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^1119mi5A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer systemic corticosteroids in acute care settings to speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapses in all adult, adolescent, and pediatric (6–11 years of age) patients with asthma exacerbation, except for the mildest exacerbations.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EpqPw]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or short-acting β-agonist), and a short course of oral corticosteroids in the discharge medications. Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely. Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2–7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112uwgAT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aFjD9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^114g1LAj]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Acute asthma [^115ykJrg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common medical emergency in children. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and poses a tremendous societal burden worldwide. Management of the acute attack involves a stepwise approach that includes beta-agonist and steroid therapy, the mainstay of emergency treatment. Most patients will respond to this regime and can be discharged from the emergency department. Failure to respond to treatment necessitates hospital admission and sometimes admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management in the ICU involves intensification of pharmacologic therapy, including nonstandard therapies, in an attempt to avoid intubation and ventilation. When needed, mechanical ventilatory support can be rendered fairly safe with little morbidity if the likely cardiorespiratory physiologic derangements are appreciated and if appropriate ventilatory strategies are used. In the past two decades, the availability of newer potent medications and changes in approach to monitoring and ventilatory strategies have resulted in a decrease in ICU morbidity and mortality rates. Research endeavors are presently underway to further characterize the underlying mechanisms of the disease and are likely to lead to novel therapies. This article reviews the approach to management of acute severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112jnau7]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use IV aminophylline or theophylline for the management of asthma exacerbations due to their poor efficacy and safety profile, and the greater effectiveness and relative safety of short-acting β-agonist.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.
