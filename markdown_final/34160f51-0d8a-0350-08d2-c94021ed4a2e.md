## Question

The owner of a parcel of land received the following letter from a buyer: "I will pay you $2,200 an acre for [theparcel]". The owner's letter of reply stated, "I accept your offer". Unknown to the owner, the buyer had intendedto offer only $2,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed "$2,200". As both parties knew, comparable land in thevicinity had been selling at prices between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?

Answer Choices:
A. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.
B. There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.
C. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.
D. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the legal consequences of a mistaken offer and acceptance in a land sale, specifically whether a contract was formed and at what price. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the objective elements of offer and acceptance are present. Then, I should verify whether the mistake is unilateral or mutual and whether it relates to a basic assumption. Next, I will consider whether the mistake is material and whether the adversely affected party can reasonably avoid the consequences. After that, I should review the doctrine of objective manifestation and the "meeting of the minds" concept. Finally, I will apply these principles to the facts and choose the best answer among the options, noting any exceptions or remedies that might apply.

> Let me first confirm the objective elements of contract formation. The buyer's letter stated a definite price and identified the subject matter, which constitutes a clear offer, and the owner's reply "I accept your offer" is a plain, unequivocal acceptance, so offer and acceptance are present on their face, which would ordinarily create a contract under objective theory even if the buyer subjectively intended a different price.

> Wait, let me verify the nature of the mistake. The buyer's error is unilateral, not mutual, because only the buyer knew of the discrepancy between intended ($2,000) and expressed ($2,200) price; the owner was unaware of the buyer's true intention, so this is not a mutual mistake scenario, which would require both parties to share a mistaken belief about a basic assumption of the contract.

> I need to check whether the mistake is material and whether the buyer can reasonably avoid the consequences. The price term is certainly material, but the fact that comparable land sells between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre means the stated $2,200 falls within a commercially reasonable range, so the owner had no reason to suspect a typographical error and could not reasonably be expected to inquire further, which weakens the buyer's claim that the contract should be voided for mistake.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rescission. Unilateral mistake alone is generally not enough to void a contract; relief is limited to situations where the mistake is so grave that enforcement would be unconscionable, the non-mistaken party had reason to know of the mistake, or the mistake is attributable to a clerical or mathematical error in the drafting or transcription of the contract, none of which is clearly established here given the owner's lack of knowledge and the market context.

> Let me consider the objective manifestation doctrine. Under that principle, a party's intention is judged by what a reasonable person in the position of the other party would understand from the words and conduct, not by the secret, subjective intention; here, a reasonable seller would understand the offer as $2,200 per acre and the acceptance as agreeing to that price, so a contract was formed at $2,200 per acre despite the buyer's internal mistake.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might be a mutual mistake case because both parties might be said to be mistaken about the "true" price, but that would be incorrect; the owner was not mistaken about the price term as expressed, so the mistake is unilateral, and the objective theory still binds the buyer to the terms as reasonably understood by the owner, which supports option D rather than B.

> I should double-check whether any exception applies that would allow reformation or rescission. Courts may grant relief for unilateral mistake in narrow circumstances, such as when the non-mistaken party knew or had reason to know of the mistake, or when the mistake is a clerical error in expression, but here the owner had no such knowledge and the market context did not flag an obvious error, so the contract remains enforceable at $2,200 per acre, with any remedy for the buyer being limited and uncertain in this scenario.

> Putting this together, the correct answer is D: there is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention, because offer and acceptance are objectively present and the mistake is unilateral without the special circumstances that would permit avoidance of the contract.

---

The most likely legal outcome is that **a contract was formed at $2,200 per acre** because the buyer's offer was clear and the owner's acceptance matched it, creating an objectively enforceable agreement under the objective theory of contracts. The buyer's unilateral mistake about the price is not grounds to void the contract unless the owner knew or had reason to know of the error, which is not indicated here. While the buyer may seek equitable relief such as reformation or rescission, that remedy is discretionary and typically unavailable when the mistake is unilateral and the other party had no reason to suspect it.

---

## Legal principles applicable to the scenario

### Objective theory of contracts

Under the objective theory, **contract formation** depends on the outward expressions of the parties, not their subjective intentions. If a reasonable person would interpret the buyer's letter as an offer to buy at $2,200 per acre, that is the operative offer, regardless of the buyer's internal intent. Similarly, the owner's "I accept your offer" constitutes a valid acceptance, forming a contract at $2,200 per acre.

---

### Unilateral mistake

A unilateral mistake occurs when only one party is mistaken about a material fact. Generally, such a mistake **does not invalidate a contract** unless the non-mistaken party knew or had reason to know of the mistake, or the mistake is so obvious that it should have been apparent. Here, there is no indication the owner knew or should have known the buyer intended $2,000; the $2,200 figure falls within the range of comparable sales, so the owner had no reason to suspect an error.

---

### Mutual mistake

Mutual mistake requires both parties to share a fundamental mistake about a basic assumption. That is not present here because the owner was not mistaken about the price; only the buyer was. Thus, this is **not a mutual mistake** case.

---

### Equitable remedies: reformation and rescission

Equitable remedies may allow reformation (correction) or rescission (cancellation) for mistake, but they are discretionary and generally require:

- The mistake is material and not due to gross negligence.
- The non-mistaken party knew or had reason to know of the mistake.
- Enforcement would be unconscionable.

Here, the buyer's mistake is unilateral, the owner had no reason to know, and enforcement at $2,200 is not unconscionable given the market range. Thus, **equitable relief is unlikely**.

---

## Analysis of the answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Legal analysis** | **Conclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| A. No contract due to materially different meanings | Incorrect. The objective theory shows a meeting of the minds at $2,200 per acre. | Incorrect |
| B. No enforceable contract due to mutual mistake | Incorrect. This is a unilateral, not mutual, mistake. | Incorrect |
| C. Contract at $2,000 per acre as the buyer intended | Incorrect. Subjective intent is irrelevant under the objective theory. | Incorrect |
| D. Contract at $2,200 per acre regardless of buyer's true intention | Correct. Objective manifestations create a contract at $2,200 per acre. | Correct |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct answer is **D. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention**. The objective theory of contracts governs, and the buyer's unilateral mistake does not invalidate the agreement. The buyer may attempt to seek equitable relief, but such remedies are discretionary and unlikely to succeed under these facts.

Improving strategies for price benchmarking

An important factor in determining a fair price for a medicine is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a given clinical benefit. Buyers have used several different methods to benchmark medicine prices and facilitate purchasing. None of these strategies alone will achieve lower prices, but the recent drive for additional transparency and collaboration has made buyers more active purchasers in determining what is fair in their goal of achieving access for their populations.

Setting a benchmark using price information from other countries, with similar socioeconomic status, is one method that buyers have used to control costs — known as external reference pricing. This method generally uses a declared list price that can differ substantially from the actual price paid, given confidential discounts and rebates. The widespread use of external reference pricing, particularly in Europe, has been criticised because of its reliance on list price. The interconnected web of countries referencing each other's prices has potentially affected launch sequencing across countries, thereby directly affecting patient access.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^114KGBgc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers — a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin. It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome. Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers' power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender. Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale. For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998–2002). Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

Buy-sell agreements for shareholders entering and leaving a radiology practice are different from those commonly used in other business endeavors. This paper explores the reasons for these differences, focusing on the culture of radiology and its unique influence on the buy-sell process. Buy-sell methodologies commonly used in most business transactions are described, and basic principles that influence these methodologies are discussed. The reasons these traditional methods are not applicable to most radiology groups are explored in depth. The paper concludes with a presentation of several workable buy-sell options for radiology practices. The strengths and weaknesses of these options are enumerated, so that each group can customize the option that best suits its needs.

Improving strategies for selection and coverage

Buyers have developed several tools to ensure that a new single source medicine reaches appropriate patients. Budget and systems planning can ensure that price negotiations begin with an accurate forecast of the need for, and potential benefit of, a new medicine within a population. Many clinical benefits of a new medicine are common across countries, although their manner of use may need to be adapted to national situations. Thus, strategies for selection and coverage are an area ripe for improvement through additional collaboration and transparency.

Many health systems use horizon scanning for early awareness of medicines that could enter a market. In this way, buyers gain sufficient lead time to analyse the potential effect of a new medicine on the health system and develop strategies to cope with its introduction. Medicines can be prioritised for further review based on criteria such as potential health benefit, potential to trigger system changes, and unit cost or effect on the budget. Horizon scanning is administratively burdensome, but information gathering can be a collaborative effort. For example, nine European countries to date are collaborating in establishing the International Horizon Scanning Initiative.

The World Health Organization recommends that countries use health technology assessment as a tool to support decision making about reimbursement, price setting, and negotiation. The assessment is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit and scientifically robust methods to weigh up the value of using a health technology, such as at launch, when additional real world evidence about its use is available, and once competitor products reach the market. However, health technology assessment requires significant resources, including staff with training in health economics who can critically assess technical dossiers. Countries looking to introduce such assessment should take a stepwise approach to developing legislative and technical capacity to take full advantage of it in pharmaceutical price setting and reimbursement. National academic institutions can help in developing capacity and can serve as external reviewers and train health technology assessors.

Buyers can extract larger discounts from manufacturers by threatening to offer only limited coverage for a medicine, or to leave it out of a benefit package, national list, or formulary. Without an agreement there is no market. In the US, both the Veterans Health Administration and the Department of Defense negotiate lower prices directly with manufacturers, using formularies to manage which medicines they cover.

The case for collaboration

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly important for medicines that are only available from a single source (a monopoly). Price negotiations can deliver mixed results where negotiations are based on discounts from a "list price" ceiling set by the seller, rather than a negotiating floor that reflects the cost of production.

No single strategy or policy can lead to a fair price for medicines. Each policy has its benefits and drawbacks, and thus it is important that it is not used in isolation. For buyers a robust strategy would make use of elements of each policy and be adapted to country characteristics.

In the absence of transparent data, buyers need to maximise their market power (monopsony power) to rival the monopoly they are confronting, otherwise an imbalance in market forces can lead to market failure. By imposing some of the strategies outlined above, payers have asserted their buying power and come closer to achieving a fair price.

Buyers seeking fairer prices benefit from both transparency and collaboration, but this requires strong commitment from decision makers. International commitment is emerging, with a recent World Health Assembly resolution on improving the transparency of markets. Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders.

Key messages

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly acute for single source medicines — that is, medicines lacking an alternative with a similar indication (monopoly)
Price negotiations deliver mixed results, particularly when anchored by discounts from a "list price" ceiling set by the seller, with no transparency about the true costs of development and production that could anchor a negotiating floor
In the absence of transparent data, the closest that buyers can get to fairer pricing is to impose regulations and policies that attempt to assert their buying power
Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders

For high cost medicines with uncertain benefits, healthcare systems can put conditions on how a medicine is used or paid for using a managed entry agreement. Conditions can be financial discounts and rebates, or more complex arrangements based on outcome. Managed entry agreements often specify collection of additional data to enable future decision making about new products with limited current evidence. Technical and practical challenges exist with such arrangements. Implementation can be limited by technical factors — for example, data collection in routine care can be costly and might yield less evidence than expected. In addition, delisting a treatment can raise objections from patients, who consider that they are being denied treatment, despite efforts to explain that a medicine is less effective than expected.

Buyers can use a variety of tools to improve their spending forecasts. Some can be used while research and development are still under way, as in the case of horizon scanning. Other tools, such as formularies and health technology assessment, allow buyers to select medicines once approved for marketing. In recent years managed entry agreements have reduced financial risk, particularly for medicines with uncertain benefits. Recognition that each of these processes is improved with better data reporting has led to an increased push for transparency and collaboration.

Pricing as a reflection of value

Pricing based on the R&D costs of one approved molecule does not account for all the others that did not make it to the market. Additionally, while we tend to focus on the successful products in the existing R&D ecosystem, the literature has shown that both successful and failed R&D efforts have generated important scientific knowledge that has improved the efficiency of our R&D system. Put simply, it is impossible to innovate without failure, and it is important to recognize that failures are valuable, too, because what we learn — as an R&D ecosystem — from our failures helps us to eventually succeed.

If we agree that providing sufficient rewards is essential to incentivize biopharmaceutical R&D, what should society pay? Firstly, this may seem a strange question to those who operate in the actual market-based system, because the answer they often encounter is that payers try to pay as little as possible. If faced with enough choices, payers, specifically PBMs in the USA, can simply play companies off against one another and take the best offers. Understandably pre-occupied with their own priorities, none of these individual payers is directly concerned with rewarding innovation from the societal perspective. Innovators are constantly trying to invent something uniquely useful in the hope that they will not face too much competition and will therefore have pricing power. In other words, they want to be able to control the supply of a product that buyers want badly enough to pay the price that the innovator sets, and even where there are a few competitors, companies tend to be savvy enough not to trigger a ruinous price war, which is why it often takes loss of exclusivity and many generic competitors entering the market to drive a drug's price down steeply.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^112xhv1t]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Restrictions on property — public health emergency powers may permit a range of action by state and local governments to restrict, secure, and manage property during an emergency response, with examples including decontamination of facilities, acquisition of vaccines, medicines, or hospital beds, and use of private facilities for isolation, quarantine, or disposal of human remains. Once a public health emergency has been declared, some states allow authorities to use and take temporary control of certain private sector businesses and activities that are of critical importance to epidemic control measures; authorities may take control of landfills and other disposal facilities and services to safely eliminate infectious waste, health-care facilities and supplies may be procured or controlled to treat and care for patients and the general public, and areas normally accessible to the public may be closed to prevent additional exposures. Whenever health authorities take private property to use for public health purposes, constitutional law requires that the property owner be provided just compensation, meaning the state must pay private owners for the use of their property. Under existing legal powers to abate public nuisances, authorities are able to condemn, remove, or destroy any property that may harm the public's health, and permissible property control measures may include restricting certain commercial transactions and practices, such as price gouging. Because the application of law varies in different states, it is advisable to consult with an attorney to understand the applicable law in any particular jurisdiction.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^116T3Du5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cooperative risk‐anticipating, monitoring, and corrective actions are built in all along the way

SEPPE would also set aside the limiting and expensive practice whereby, if something goes wrong with the performance of product or evidence, post hoc appraisal and potential scientific or regulatory intervention are deployed to try to save the day. Because SEPPE takes for granted that flaws and problems are bound to occur throughout, a third premise is that explicit, active, preventive and more distributed risk‐managing and risk‐communicating efforts — understanding when and why they need to be taken — must become the norm to minimize the occurrence, frequency and impact of these events. SEPPE would compel the structuring of specific, comprehensive activities in anticipation of the things that could go wrong, in the form of overtly described and well‐controlled monitoring, feedback‐and‐adjustment loops; moreover, these would be iterative in both smaller and larger frames. Key decision‐makers would, thus, be enabled to contribute to — and be comfortable with — initial development strategies and evidence designs, as well as possible continuing adaptations prompted by the evolving evidence and other contextual considerations.

In a nutshell, each participant in planning, production, and evaluation would be responsible for neither making, nor accepting, nor passing along a defect 92 (i.e. avoidable product, decision, and/or evidence problem/uncertainty). A resulting feature of SEPPE‐generated products (i.e. quality evidence and product deliverables) is that these would be explicitly acknowledged by stakeholder partners as "best quality possible" — a decided improvement over the current situation.

### Mapping out the arguments for and against patient non-attendance fees in healthcare: an analysis of public consultation documents [^111h5YC9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conceptual framework

Incentives (and disincentives), for example, a monetary benefit (or a cost), are intentionally designed to supply extrinsic reasons to make a particular choice. Thus, incentives may be used as a tool in regulative polices to motivate behavioural change and steer citizens' behaviour. Grant has presented two different approaches to how incentives are best conceptualised and understood. In the most prevalent view, incentives are perceived as a form of trade. According to economic thought, an incentive '[…] alter[s] the balance of the costs and benefits of a particular choice so as to alter a person's course of action' (Grant, p35). Individuals are seen as rational beings capable of acting consistently with their preferences and who are free to choose between alternatives. When a voluntary economic transaction occurs, it is because all parties think they are better (or not worse) off than they were before. Thus, the pivotal question is whether this exchange between the parties is voluntary, in the sense that they are free to reject the offer. Incentives understood as a voluntary economic transaction appear inherently ethical; all parties are better off.

However, the design and use of incentives may raise important ethical issues beyond voluntariness that the economic approach to incentives cannot answer. For example, a minimalist conception of rationality and freedom makes it difficult to recognise attacks on autonomous choice that are more broadly construed to include the capacity to set one's own ends. Incentives may be used in ways that are paternalistic, manipulative or exploitative, even if the individual is free to refuse them. To see how this may happen, Grant suggests that incentives should be analysed as a form of power. Thus, the use of incentives is one possible answer to the question, 'How can one person get another person to do what he wants him to do?'(Grant, p29)

Grant argues that the use of incentives can be more or less normatively defensible as a legitimate means of altering behaviour. To judge the legitimacy of a particular use of an incentive, we should assess whether incentives serve a rationally defensible purpose; allow for a voluntarily response; and are in line with requirements of moral character or institutional culture. Moreover, taking into account the broader context in which the incentive operates, the incentive under investigation must be compared with alternative available measures. Three additional factors must be considered: fairness, effectiveness and the absence of undue influence.

Vaccine purchasing and office immunization — obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care providers are "encouraged to stock and, ideally, administer commonly recommended vaccines in their offices", and rates are "higher when a health care provider can offer and administer the vaccine during the same visit" rather than refer elsewhere. Practices "may wish to research vaccine manufacturers for available special pricing offers", recognizing price "may vary by the vendor" with possible discounts "based on when and how the practice orders and pays", and they "also can explore group purchasing organizations or develop partnerships with nearby clinics and pharmacies" to obtain discounted rates. These tasks "can be delegated to the immunization champion or team in the practice", and providers "should consult their legal counsel regarding discounts and group purchasing organizations because certain restrictions may apply".

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Global challenges in preparedness and response to epidemic infectious diseases [^114n2vWn]. Molecular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Last but not least: Ensuring availability and access

Too often, the battle about access is unsuitably centered on the final product, when in reality it starts much upstream.

A key characteristic of market failure is that market demand-and-supply dynamics do not leverage R&D, availability, and access when the purchasing power of those affected is too small to attract commercial interest. Fixing the market failure for R&D — for instance, through public funding or other market incentives — does not guarantee that the resulting interventions will be registered, available, and accessible in countries where outbreaks occur. Outside an ongoing outbreak, there may be little urge for companies to seek product registration, or for countries or public health authorities to purchase (for stockpiling) the new product if registered — unless motivated by reasons like health security. As a result, critical health technologies that have been developed are not necessarily available where and when an outbreak occurs.

Since licensure is granted to pharmaceutical companies, even if the research was done by broad consortia of public and private partners, the control over product availability — how much is being manufactured and sold to whom and at what price — is essentially in the hands of the private sector. A company typically holds both IP rights via patents on products and technologies and retains exclusivity on the use of data contained in the regulatory dossier, precluding others to produce and sell the products. Such monopolies compound the fragility of an already precarious supply chain. Reliance on a single source for the supply of critical health technologies is a recipe for scarcity, high prices, or both, with major impact on equitable access. The inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine access in Africa for instance are explained in part to the lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity on the continent (currently importing 99% of all vaccines used).

Too often, companies will prioritize licensure in markets of interest, primarily the United States, Europe, and a handful of other countries that may be interested in establishing strategic stockpiles for certain diseases of epidemic potential. For products that are eligible to receive a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher, an incentive to stimulate the development of drugs or vaccines against neglected tropical diseases, filoviruses (including Ebola), rare pediatric indications, and medical countermeasures for certain global health security threats, the financial reward is obtained upon registration at the US FDA. Unfortunately, obtention of the reward is not linked to any obligation for availability or access where needed.

### Global'side effects' of the EU's pharmaceutical reforms and their impact on access to medicines in LMICs [^115gVTud]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Unintentional global reach of EU pharma rules

This section introduces two salient examples of proposals for new rules that may unintentionally be disseminated outside the Union through externalisation and/or mimicry (described elsewhere). What these examples share in common is that the EU's rules, standards and/or decisions travel globally due to the Union's sheer presence on the international scene, rather than purely its active (self-)promotion.

First, introducing more transparency to the components of a medicine's price is one strategy some lawmakers use to help negotiate or set more affordable prices. In that light, the European Commission proposed new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers to report the public contributions towards the R&D of a particular medicine covered by a national or central market authorisation (article 57(1–2)). These reports would be made available in a public EU database. If adopted, this requirement would be the first rule in the world to oblige a form of financial disclosure at the point of market authorisation. The EU's rule would be one step towards greater disclosure of the price components of a pharmaceutical, in line with the World Health Assembly Resolution 72.8 on the transparency of pharmaceutical markets, towards which progress is still needed. If adopted, the EU's legal text may serve as a source of inspiration for legal reform in other countries. Moreover, the EU's database of public R&D subsidies may be used by procurement agencies (both international agencies serving LMICs and those in LMICs) to inform their negotiations and purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies. It is also conceivable that some foreign lawmakers may be inspired by the EU's political will to regulate corporate financial disclosures and thereby introduce similar regulations. Consequently, greater price transparency is a logical step to inform better medicine price negotiation between public bodies and private companies and may support lower purchase prices, which can positively impact on patient access and human health in LMICs.

### Evaluation of a national supermarket intervention supporting vulnerable families in healthy meal practices: a natural experiment [^117Eqc4K]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the sample

To evaluate the impact of the DS123 intervention on participating families' food purchasing patterns, Colruyt provided us with anonymized purchase data from 166 vulnerable households, after receiving the informed consent of these families. To recruit the households, Colruyt wrote an e-mail to all Dutch-speaking clients who participate in the project and used their loyalty card at least once in the past 12 months. Two rounds of recruiting (i.e. sending of e-mails) occurred. The first round was on February 23th, 2023, which provided us with 101 participating families. The second round was on March 16th of that same year and resulted in an additional 65 families. The dataset covered all purchases made by the participating families when they used their loyalty card at Colruyt over the period of four and a half years (June 2018 until December 2022). Furthermore, it contained details on every purchase category. Shopper-related characteristics were shopper ID and enrollment date for the intervention. Shopping trip characteristics were ticket/receipt number, date of purchase, shopping location, and product items purchased. Product-related characteristics were product group (as predefined by Colruyt), Nutri-Score, unit (piece/kilo), and unit price (without the guaranteed price correction).

For data cleaning purposes, we excluded all non-food product purchases from the dataset. We excluded 32 households from the analysis as they were already enrolled in DS123 prior to the study period. This exclusion was necessary due to the indeterminacy of their enrollment duration, a critical variable in our analysis. Consequently, data of 134 respondents was retained for the analyses.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^115hmka7]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry — this section describes psychological influence techniques used by industry representatives, including commitment/consistency tactics in which clinicians are asked to try a product on the next 5 or 10 patients, after which continued use is more likely. Social proof underlies peer advocacy among physicians, liking is leveraged by friendly and attractive interactions, appeals to authority rely on deference to experts, and scarcity encourages rapid acceptance of offered opportunities. Reciprocity is emphasized: gifts create an obligation to reciprocate and take many forms, including free product samples, pens, mugs, speaking or consulting opportunities, meals, trips, free CME, publication and authorship opportunities, and research grants. The section explains that much cognitive activity occurs without conscious awareness, that favors and gifts independent of monetary value influence behavior at a subconscious level, and that although clinicians may assume prescribing is rational, much human decision making does not use a rational assessment of pros and cons.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^113QdHad]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To examine the effect of over-harvesting on the natural resource and on the discount rate, we compare scenarios in which over-harvesting occurs to scenarios in which it does not. We consider two approaches. First, we consider a competitive market approach in which we compare the optimal solution that maximizes social welfare with the solution that emerges in a model of a perfectly competitive market with externalities (Figs. 2 and 3). Specifically, the competitive market includes managed regions that have a single manager (e.g. landowner, government), and shared regions in which multiple managers are free to harvest (e.g. open-access) (see Methods). Second, we consider a more general approach in which we compare the dynamics that emerge when the harvest is entirely sustainable with the dynamics that emerge following various ad hoc choices of non-sustainable harvest functions (Theorem and Fig. 4).

### An analysis of purchase price of legal and illicit cigarettes in urban retail environments in 14 low-and middle-income countries [^1168hAsD]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study contributes to the literature on the price of legal and illicit cigarette packs in LMICs and, to our knowledge, is the first to assess systematically the relationship between price and pack legality in multiple LMICs using a standard protocol and actual purchase price data. We found a large variation across countries in terms of the price difference between legal and illicit cigarettes. While it was not the focus of our study, and the proportion of packs purchased should not be interpreted as the volume of illicit packs on the market, the fact that we were able to purchase a substantial number of illicit packs from formal retailers should be noted.

The methodology used in this study has limitations. The sample of packs does not represent the market share of brands in each country, as only one pack of each unique representation was purchased. Therefore, an analysis of price variation throughout packs of the same brand variant was not possible. Given the sample, inferential statistical testing was not possible. The variation observed across countries in terms of discordance between appropriate HWL and indication of tax paid, with Brazil accounting for the majority (seven of 11 packs), may be due to it being our pilot country and, as mentioned previously, we suspect that tax stamps may have fallen off during handling and transit. It was also not possible to verify whether the displayed health warnings were fake or if the indicators of tax paid were counterfeit, and therefore it is possible that some packs coded as legal packs were misclassified. In countries such as Russia, Brazil and Indonesia, which have been reported to have high rates of illicit cigarette trade 4, we would have expected to find illicit cigarettes in the retail environment. This suggests that illicit trade is kept separate from the retail environment or that it is more difficult to identify illicit cigarettes in those countries. At the time of data collection, a track and trace system was in place in Brazil and Turkey 29. Track and trace systems involve placing unique codes or stamps on each tobacco pack that offers access to information (for example, the location of manufacture and intended destination) and allows for monitoring and control of the movement of the product 5. Track and trace systems are a way to control the supply chain and investigate illicit trade 5. While Brazil and Turkey both use digital tax stamps 30, the differences observed between countries with regard to the number of packs categorized as illicit in Turkey and no illicit packs being found in Brazil, may be due to different levels of trace and trace security. Turkey updated its track and trace system in 2014, after data collection was completed 10. Additionally, beyond categorizing packs as illicit and legal, distinctions between categories such as legally imported, smuggled, counterfeit and illicit white cigarettes were not made during coding.

### Why it is probably too soon to assess the public health effects of legalisation of recreational cannabis use in the USA [^111dP9ZA]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

The citizens of four US states-Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington-have voted to legalise the sale of cannabis to adults for recreational purposes, and more states look likely to follow. Experience with alcohol and tobacco suggests that a for-profit legal cannabis industry will increase use by making cannabis more socially acceptable to use, making it more readily available at a cheaper price, and increasing the number of users and frequency of their use. We argue that it is too early to see the full effects of legalised cannabis policies on use and harm because several factors could delay the full commercialisation of a legal cannabis industry. These factors include restrictions on various licensed producers and sellers, and legal conflicts between Federal and State laws that might provide a brake on the speed and scale of commercialisation in states that have legalised cannabis. Any increases in cannabis use and harm could be minimised if governments introduced public health policies that limited the promotional activities of a legal cannabis industry, restricted cannabis availability to adults, and maintained cannabis prices at a substantial fraction of the black market price. So far, no states have chosen to implement these policies.

### The (possible) impact of comparative effectiveness research on pharmaceutical industry decision making [^114eRs62]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Public and private payers in rich and emerging economies are becoming increasingly interested in using evidence to inform health-care resource allocation decisions. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom has been doing so on behalf of the National Health Service (NHS) for more than 10 years. To some, NICE-type entities are barriers to access and innovation. Increasingly, however, even NICE's critics appreciate that evidence-informed decision making, carried out in a fair, inclusive, and transparent way, is better than arbitrary government-imposed price cuts. For health-care systems in developed and developing countries around the world, faced with limited budgets, there may be no third option.

### Neural circuits in the brain that are activated when mitigating criminal sentences [^117D1uKT]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

The current finding would also contribute to the attribution literature on situational correction, as there has not been any fMRI work on this. People often attribute behaviour to the corresponding personal disposition, which is, yet, corrected based on situational inducements too. This is an apt psychological function behind mitigating circumstances that is to make someone less culpable, and the revealed brain activity might be associated with this type of situational correction.

Finally, we note that many legal principles treat emotional responses as likely to be prejudicial and prone to inflammatory manipulation (that is, an ideal juror would suppress them and legal rules limit their influence). Weighing mitigating circumstances during sentencing (after a verdict) represents an unusual case in which emotional sympathy judgment is actually required. Japanese criminal law, for example, requires that the decision among these sentences be based on mitigating circumstances.

Ironically, the fact that sympathy is clearly evident in brain activity, and influences sentence mitigation (as it should), raises interest in the opposite question: can people also suspend emotions when the law instructs them to? More generally, a deeper understanding of the brain could help figure out how highly evolved brain structures, which were sculpted to maintain order in small-scale ancestral societies, can be put to work under modern legal rules in much more challenging cases to create modern justice.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^112sgXni]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The financial motivation to earn advertising revenue has been widely conjectured to be pivotal for the production of online misinformation 1–4. Research aimed at mitigating misinformation has so far focused on interventions at the user level 5–8, with little emphasis on how the supply of misinformation can itself be countered. Here we show how online misinformation is largely financed by advertising, examine how financing misinformation affects the companies involved, and outline interventions for reducing the financing of misinformation. First, we find that advertising on websites that publish misinformation is pervasive for companies across several industries and is amplified by digital advertising platforms that algorithmically distribute advertising across the web. Using an information-provision experiment 9, we find that companies that advertise on websites that publish misinformation can face substantial backlash from their consumers. To examine why misinformation continues to be monetized despite the potential backlash for the advertisers involved, we survey decision-makers at companies. We find that most decision-makers are unaware that their companies' advertising appears on misinformation websites but have a strong preference to avoid doing so. Moreover, those who are unaware and uncertain about their company's role in financing misinformation increase their demand for a platform-based solution to reduce monetizing misinformation when informed about how platforms amplify advertising placement on misinformation websites. We identify low-cost, scalable information-based interventions to reduce the financial incentive to misinform and counter the supply of misinformation online.

### Three diverse motives for information sharing [^112qSYrY]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results suggest that people use their own information preferences to solve complex information-sharing decisions. In particular, when deciding whether to inform others, participants assigned similar relative weights to the usefulness of information, its valence, and the level of uncertainty as they do when deciding whether to seek information for themselves. These results suggest that people likely put themselves in the receiver's position to determine whether to inform others. Specifically, we found that participants shared information more when (i) the recipient could use it to gain rewards and avoid losses (i.e. when it had instrumental utility), (ii) when it was good news for the recipient rather than bad news and (iii) when the recipient was under high uncertainty. Sharers used the same rules to decide when to share information as they did to decide when to seek information. Importantly, the results suggest that they implement those rules from the point of view of the recipient, not their own. They seemed to consider the recipient s' level of uncertainty, whether the recipient can use the information and how the information would make the recipient feel. They clearly did not consider their own point of view when sharing, as they were always completely certain of the content of the information and could not use information in any way to better their material outcome. In fact, that is a fundamental distinction between seeking and sharing information - the former involves uncertainty about the information's content, while the latter assumes full knowledge. Importantly, despite this difference, information sharers can still adopt the recipient's perspective and potentially anticipate their curiosity when deciding what to share.

One may wonder what motivated participants to share information, as there was no monetary incentive in the information-sharing task. Analysis of participants' explicit written responses when asked, "How did you decide whether to open the envelope for the other participants?" suggests that participants were motivated by the other participant's welfare. Many explicitly referenced the other participant (using words such as 'they', 'them', 'others', and 'the participant') and considered the material and emotional impact of the shared information on the other person (using words like 'disappointment' or 'good news') and expressed a desire to help ("to help others out without making them feel bad"). This is consistent with many studies showing that people will help others, including strangers, even when there is no clear and immediate benefit to the self.

Unfortunately, errors and mistakes are part of life. Errors and mistakes can harm patients and incur unplanned costs. Errors may arise from various sources, which may be classified as systematic, latent, or active. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors also contribute to incorrect decisions. In addition to cognitive biases, our personality, socialization, personal chronobiology, and way of thinking (heuristic versus analytical) are influencing factors. Factors such as overload from private situations, long commuting times, and the complex environment of information technology must also be considered. The objective of this paper is to define and classify errors and mistakes in radiology, to discuss the influencing factors, and to present strategies for prevention. Hierarchical responsibilities and team "well-being" are also discussed.

### Replacing underperforming protected areas achieves better conservation outcomes [^115eYtfv]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Protected areas vary enormously in their contribution to conserving biodiversity, and the inefficiency of protected area systems is widely acknowledged. However, conservation plans focus overwhelmingly on adding new sites to current protected area estates. Here we show that the conservation performance of a protected area system can be radically improved, without extra expenditure, by replacing a small number of protected areas with new ones that achieve more for conservation. Replacing the least cost-effective 1% of Australia's 6,990 strictly protected areas could increase the number of vegetation types that have 15% or more of their original extent protected from 18 to 54, of a maximum possible of 58. Moreover, it increases markedly the area that can be protected, with no increase in overall spending. This new paradigm for protected area system expansion could yield huge improvements to global conservation at a time when competition for land is increasingly intense.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^115iBm58]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To address external validity concerns, we incorporate additional exit outcomes in the paper, showing that treated individuals switched to lower preference products (Table 1, columns 3 and 4) and products across categories (Table 1, columns 5 and 6) after our information interventions by 8 and 5 percentage points, respectively. We also show in Supplementary Table 8 that as the difference between participants' highest weighted and second highest weighted gift card choice increases, their switching behaviour decreases. This shows that the weights assigned by participants to their gift card options are capturing meaningful and costly differences in value, highlighting the external validity of our findings. More generally, our pre-registered heterogeneity analysis lends credence to the study's external validity. In line with expectations, we find that less frequent users and more politically liberal individuals are likelier to switch (see Extended Data Table 3 for the full set of pre-registered heterogeneity results). Moreover, we find that the cost of switching gift cards varies based on participants' observable characteristics. For example, treated participants who reported not using any of the misinformation news outlets in our survey lost 50% of the median value (US$12.50) of their initial top choice gift card whereas treated participants who reported reading such outlets lost 33.3% of the median value (US$8.33) of their initial top choice gift card. Participants' text responses also indicate that they believed their choices to be consequential (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). As an example, while explaining their choice of gift card, one participant stated, "Because I would most likely use this gift card on my next visit to… and it is less likely that i would use the others". Regarding the petition outcome, one participant stated "The source of this problem seems to be from the digital advertising platforms, so I'd rather sign the petition that stops them from putting ads on misinformation websites".

### Elusive quality: the challenges and ethical dilemmas faced by international non-governmental organisations in sourcing quality assured medical products [^115faTJa]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Although a staple method for NDRAs (and one that is encouraged by the WHO), a 'reliance' approach to quality assurance is unfeasible for many iNGOs. This technique involves establishing equivalence of each batch of a medical product with one that is approved by a 'trusted' NDRA, or auditor. This desk-based assessment may be advantageous in terms of cost and personnel security but, as it involves a review of dossiers and documentation for each individual product, it is dependent on access to commercially sensitive information (and staff with the skill to interpret it). Ideally, this is achieved via cross-organisational information-sharing agreements, but iNGOs may lack the negotiating power (that NDRAs enjoy) to broker such an exchange. Instead therefore, they may need to piece together data from public domains (eg, the list of European Medicines Agency-approved manufacturers), the host government, partner organisations and the manufacturer themselves. Not only is this time-consuming, it is unlikely to yield the sufficiently detailed or validated information that is necessary for evidence-based decision-making.

Furthermore, iNGOs that require a range of commodities may prefer wholesalers who are a 'one-stop-shop' and may, therefore, deem the evaluation of individual production lines of a manufacturer to be unworkable (or pointless, if the minimum order quantities are greater than their needs). Thus, based on the same concept of trust and reliance, charities with the risk appetite to do so may conduct remote assessments of vendors (not individual products) using shared or publicly obtainable information. As the procurement habits of a humanitarian organisation are unlikely to overlap with that of an HIC, data from a stringent and reliable NDRA (ie, benchmarked at Level 1 or 2) are in short supply. Reports of a trusted auditor (eg, QUAMED) may be available but are unlikely to yield positive results, or it may only be possible to gather several pieces of vague and decontextualised data — a list of the vendor's customers, for example. This practice, and the uncertainty it creates, may increase the risk of sourcing poor-quality medical products and may even invite exploitation. Given the risks, this area would benefit from scrutiny to understand the extent of (and drivers for) remote assessments and whether poor-quality data have an influence on iNGO decision-making.

### The neural correlates of third-party punishment [^115zWw6G]. Neuron (2008). Low credibility.

Legal decision-making in criminal contexts includes two essential functions performed by impartial "third parties:" assessing responsibility and determining an appropriate punishment. To explore the neural underpinnings of these processes, we scanned subjects with fMRI while they determined the appropriate punishment for crimes that varied in perpetrator responsibility and crime severity. Activity within regions linked to affective processing (amygdala, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex) predicted punishment magnitude for a range of criminal scenarios. By contrast, activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex distinguished between scenarios on the basis of criminal responsibility, suggesting that it plays a key role in third-party punishment. The same prefrontal region has previously been shown to be involved in punishing unfair economic behavior in two-party interactions, raising the possibility that the cognitive processes supporting third-party legal decision-making and second-party economic norm enforcement may be supported by a common neural mechanism in human prefrontal cortex.

### Professional practice guidelines for occupationally mandated psychological evaluations [^114XC7XD]. The American Psychologist (2018). Medium credibility.

Preparing for an OMPE — authority and referral legitimacy — Psychologists strive to understand the referring party's authority for mandating the evaluation and the legitimacy of a particular referral prior to conducting the evaluation, with legitimacy defined by sources such as law, regulation, institutional policy, collective bargaining agreement, and other authoritative guidance, considering both purpose and timing of the evaluation. Application guidance states that an employer is generally prohibited from requiring a job applicant to undergo a medical examination, except after an offer of employment has been made conditioned on the examination or inquiry and only when all entering employees are subjected to such an examination or inquiry regardless of disability, and under federal law a medical examination includes any procedure capable of revealing the nature or severity of a medical condition. Under the ADA, a job offer is not bona fide unless the employer has completed all nonmedical components and contingencies in its application process; consequently, evaluations of job applicants to rule out job-relevant psychopathology are legally prohibited prior to determination of their nonmedical eligibility and subsequent conditional offer of employment, and psychologists strive to confirm with the referring party that a conditional offer of employment has been tendered before conducting the evaluation.

### Neuronal evidence for good-based economic decisions under variable action costs [^1162zKZJ]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Experimental design and choice patterns

Figure 1a illustrates the experimental design. Notably, each offer provided information about all the determinants of value (juice type, quantity, and action cost), while preventing the animal from planning the saccade necessary to obtain the offer. Behavioral evidence indicated that the experimental manipulation was effective. Figure 1b illustrates the choice pattern recorded in one representative session. Trials were divided in two groups depending on whether juice A was offered at low cost or at high cost. The gray sigmoid is displaced to the right, indicating that the relative value of juice A was higher when juice A was offered at low cost. This effect was relatively modest, but it was consistent across sessions for both monkeys. For a quantitative analysis of choice patterns, we constructed a logistic model that provided measures for the relative value of the two juices (ρ), the difference in action cost (ξ), the choice hysteresis related to the chosen juice (η) and to the chosen cost (φ), and the spatial biases related to the offer position (δ) and to the target position (ε) (see Methods, Eq. 1).

Psychologists strive to explain consent matters in an accessible fashion and convey willingness to answer questions, may obtain consent from a legally authorized third party when an adult is incapable, and when an evaluation is court ordered, informed consent may not be necessary. Psychologists aspire to give children an age-appropriate explanation to obtain assent, consider that legal guardians may have the right to provide consent on children's behalf, and aim to inform collateral sources about who has retained the psychologist, the intended use of the knowledge obtained, and the limits of confidentiality and privacy.

### Should pregnant women be charged for non-invasive prenatal screening? Implications for reproductive autonomy and equal access [^113Yrh92]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale 2: charging women to improve informed decision-making

A second argument brought forward in public discussions for charging money for NIPT is that it will improve decision-making. A financial contribution to NIPT is thought to have the benefit of signalling to pregnant women and their partners that screening is optional: screening is an offer that may have far-reaching implications that should be considered beforehand. Because NIPT requires only a simple blood draw, just like other routine screening tests offered during the pregnancy, such as tests for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, blood type, Rhesus factor or antibodies, observers are concerned that women will thoughtlessly accept NIPT. Also, they may feel less justified in forsaking screening, as NIPT 'removes the risk to pregnancy as a reason for declining testing', and may experience societal pressure to take part in screening. Meeting the aim of reproductive autonomy is generally considered to require 'informed choice' for or against a screening offer. Participation in screening should be the result of such adequately informed, voluntary and value-consistent decisions, not of passive acceptance or acquiescence to societal pressure.

It is feared that because of the non-invasive character of NIPT, health professionals may treat the informed choice process differently — less stringently — than they would in the context of invasive testing, requiring less time to consider or not asking for written informed consent.NIPT would be presented by counsellors as a routine procedure and would consequently be perceived as such by pregnant women and their partners, a concern referred to as 'routinisation'. If women may not appreciate the significance of the test, it would 'become more difficult to achieve the aim of enabling autonomous reproductive choices'. In sum, in the absence of accepted reasons not to take part in first-trimester prenatal screening, such as safety or financial considerations, pregnant women may consider less thoroughly whether or not to take part. Also, state funding is believed to send a 'legitimizing' message about the importance of NIPT, implying that the government encourages screening, making pregnant women more likely to participate without deliberation.

### Reporting transparency: making the ethical mandate explicit [^1124hfpU]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Extrinsic values and implications for research

Obligations regarding reporting also stem from principles external to the integrity of individual researchers and reflect concerns regarding the final use of data and results. These obligations include principles of avoiding harms and promoting benefits, and fair use of resources.

If poor reporting is an impediment to appropriate implementation of research findings, then unwarranted or inappropriate use of research findings may expose patients to unnecessary risk of harm, while a failure to take up potentially beneficial research may lead to individual or population health benefits being missed. This concept is important from a perspective of distributive justice, particularly if the failure to replicate research leads to an unwarranted burden on some members of society. Being able to verify the veracity of the data and analysis will be essential in such circumstances. Moreover, there are opportunity costs to funding research. While clear reporting can facilitate replication and reproduction to validate findings, poorly reported research may precipitate a waste of resources if research funds are spent on unsuccessful attempts at reproduction that could have been circumvented had reporting been more complete. A number of studies have shown the difficulties in reproducing research findings, with many citing poor reporting of methods for the inability to reproduce results.

### Knowledge-based commissioning [^112UCEKS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

People who pay for health care aim to maximize value in allocating resources between and within patient groups. With limited health care budgets, new high value innovations will replace, not supplement, lower value interventions. Every society and its health care system must consider the issue of value and be aware that the values of payer, provider, clinician, and patient will always be different. Knowledge, while necessary, is never sufficient when commissioning health care. At times, decision maker's subjective values may outweigh objective evidence.

### Neuronal evidence for good-based economic decisions under variable action costs [^113gh3Wo]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Task-related responses

The neuronal analysis focused on sessions with no significant spatial bias (see Results). Each cell was analyzed in relation to the choice pattern recorded in the same session. In each trial, the neuronal activity was analyzed in nine time windows aligned with different behavioral events: pre-offer (0.5 s before the offer), post-offer (0.5 s after offer on), late-delay (0.5–1.0 s after offer on), mem-delay (0–0.5 s after offer off), pre-target (0.5 s before target on), post-target (0.5 s after target on), pre-go (0.5 s before the 'go'), pre-juice (0.5 s before the juice), and post-juice (0.5 s after the juice).

To identify task-related responses, each neuronal response was submitted to two three-way ANOVAs (factors [trial type × offer A location × target A location]; factors [trial type × chosen offer location × chosen target location]). We imposed a significance threshold p < 0.001. Responses that passed this criterion for at least one factor were identified as "task-related" and included in subsequent analyses.

Variable selection analysis

We conducted a series of analyses to identify the variables encoded by the neuronal population adopting the same general approach used in previous work. We defined a large number of variables that neurons in the OFC might conceivably encode, and we applied procedures for variable selection to identify a small subset of variables that best explained the neuronal data set. Previous studies on decisions under fixed action costs already examined a large number of variables. The results indicated that neurons in OFC encoded variables offer value, chosen value, and chosen juice. In contrast, the marginal explanatory power of other tested variables — including total value, other value, value difference, etc. — was very low. These results were replicated several times. Thus, in the present study we focused on variables that were not already excluded in previous work, and in particular on variables defined by (or disambiguated through) variable action costs.

### Tracking PACS usage with open source tools [^113LHYKi]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

A typical choice faced by Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) administrators is deciding how many PACS workstations are needed and where they should be sited. Oftentimes, the social consequences of having too few are severe enough to encourage oversupply and underutilization. This is costly, at best in terms of hardware and electricity, and at worst (depending on the PACS licensing and support model) in capital costs and maintenance fees. The PACS administrator needs tools to asses accurately the use to which her fleet is being subjected, and thus make informed choices before buying more workstations. Lacking a vended solution for this challenge, we developed our own.

### Considering marijuana legalization carefully: insights for other jurisdictions from analysis for Vermont [^11287qti]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

In 2014 the legislature of Vermont, USA passed a law requiring the Secretary of Administration to report on the consequences of legalizing marijuana. The RAND Corporation was commissioned to write that report. This paper summarizes insights from that analysis that are germane to other jurisdictions.

Method

Translation of key findings from the RAND Corporation report to the broader policy debate.

Results

Marijuana legalization encompasses a wide range of possible regimes, distinguished along at least four dimensions: which organizations are allowed to produce and supply the drug, the regulations under which they operate, the nature of the products that can be distributed and taxes and prices. Vermont's decriminalization had already cut its costs of enforcing marijuana prohibition against adults to about $1 per resident per year. That is probably less than the cost of regulating a legal market. Revenues from taxing residents' purchases after legalization could be many times that amount, so the main fiscal cost of prohibition after decriminalization relative to outright legalization may be foregone tax revenues, not enforcement costs. Approximately 40 times as many users live within 200 miles of Vermont's borders as live within the state; drug tourism and associated tax revenues will be important considerations, as will be the response of other states. Indeed, if another state legalized with lower taxes, that could undermine the ability to collect taxes on even Vermont residents' purchases.

Conclusions

Analysis of possible outcomes if Vermont, USA, legalized marijuana reveal that choices about how, and not just whether, to legalize a drug can have profound consequences for the effects on health and social wellbeing, and the choices of one jurisdiction can affect the options and incentives available to other jurisdictions.

### People are more error-prone after committing an error [^115SHC5v]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To address these shortcomings, we examined post-error effects using a forced-response paradigm which controls response time and treats processing time as an independent variable. In this paradigm (Fig. 1A), participants are cued to respond at the same time on each trial while the onset of the target stimulus is uniformly varied in a 4-alternative forced choice stimulus–response task (Fig. 1B). This allows us to examine post-error effects on processing per se by controlling the time of response initiation to query the state of cognitive processing as time unfolds. We use these data to fit a model that makes minimal assumptions about the cognitive processes leading to a response: (1) each stimulus leads to the preparation of the appropriate response with some mean latency and normally distributed trial-to-trial variability; (2) if stimulus-based response preparation is not yet complete, participants will guess randomly; and (3) action selection following perceptual processing is not perfect and "slips of action" sometimes occur. These assumptions lead directly to four free parameters in this model: α, the likelihood of a correct response given no response has been prepared (i.e.g.uessing); μ, the average speed of cognitive processing underlying a correct response; σ, the standard deviation (i.e. trial-to-trial variability) of the speed of cognitive processing; and β, the probability a correct response will be produced when this cognitive processing is complete (i.e. the "efficacy" of stimulus-based action selection). 1 − β is the probability that an action slip occurs even if it is very likely that enough time has elapsed for stimulus-based action selection to occur. (Note that the model is agnostic as to whether action slips are due to problems at the time of response initiation or during response preparation itself.) When combined, these parameters can be used to predict accuracy when the amount of time given for stimulus–response processing is known (Fig. 1C; see Methods for complete modeling details). In combination with controlling the time of response initiation, this modeling framework allows us to distinguish among several distinct ways in which cognitive processing might be affected following an error. Following an error, stimulus–response processing might be slower (Fig. 2A), more variable (Fig. 2B), or simply less effective at producing the correct response resulting in more frequent slips of action (Fig. 2C). Each of these possibilities would map onto a quantitative change in just one of the parameters of our model. As seen in the bottom row of Fig. 2, simulated data from our model shows that each parameter uniquely controls a certain aspect of a participant's speed-accuracy tradeoff function (e.g. slower processing coinciding with a change in μ would shift the psychometric function to the right without affecting its slope or asymptote).

### Coping with medical mistakes and errors in judgment [^116FaY8J]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Attention has recently been focused on medical errors as a cause of morbidity and mortality in clinical practice. Although much has been written regarding the cognitive aspects of decision making and the importance of systems management as an approach to medical error reduction, little consideration has been given to the emotional impact of errors on the practitioner. Evidence exists that errors are common in clinical practice and that physicians often deal with them in dysfunctional ways. However, there is no general acknowledgment within the profession of the inevitability of medical errors or of the need for practitioners to be trained in their management. This article focuses on the affective aspects of physician errors and presents a strategy for coping with them.

### The implications of fraud in medical and scientific research [^111WqGpb]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Fraud is an important issue that affects research of both scientific and clinical fields because of its potential to adversely affect patient care. Fraud can take many forms, each with varying prevalence and implications. A number of ethical institutions have been created to investigate and regulate this malpractice. Using case examples, we describe the various forms of fraud and their potential implications. The increasing importance of editorial responsibility is highlighted and discussed. Finally, we suggest solutions for how to effectively regulate and eradicate this practise.

### A neural mechanism for conserved value computations integrating information and rewards [^111aCTXY]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

LHb value signals predict online multi-attribute decisions

We hypothesized that LHb signals tracking subjective value causally contribute to decisions. If so, this would extend the role of LHb phasic signals beyond their classic role in trial-and-error reinforcement learning to online control of multi-attribute decisions. The LHb responses to each offer in our task resembled encoding of RPEs, with each offer triggering an RPE related to its subjective value. Consistent with classic findings in the LHb, these neurons also had strong RPE signals later in the task when outcomes were cued and revealed (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 15). However, LHb RPEs have been implicated in reinforcement learning more than online decision-making. If our hypothesis is correct, then variations in the LHb response to each offer should predict variations in the animal's decision about whether to choose that offer. This relationship should hold above and beyond the predictions of our models (which are fitted to the pooled data over all trials and hence cannot predict trial-to-trial variations in subjective values). For example, if an LHb neuron treats a particular offer on a particular trial as less valuable than the neural model predicts, then the animal should be less likely to choose that offer than the behavioral model predicts. Furthermore, given the negative sign of LHb value-related signals, LHb activity should be negatively associated with choice.

To test this hypothesis, we asked whether variations in LHb value signals predict variations in choice behavior (Fig. 7a). For each neuron, we computed a choice predictive index as the correlation between the animal's residual choice and the neuron's residual offer response in the direction of its value signal. That is, the correlation between the choice and the neural offer value signal, after subtracting out the animal's predicted choice and the neuron's predicted offer value signal based on fits from the attribute model (Fig. 7b, c and Model 18). Many neurons had significant positive indexes, consistent with value signals related to choice (Fig. 7e, f). If this activity related to decision-making, it might become stronger after the animal observed both offers and could decide between them. To test this, we computed the index separately for responses to the first and second offers. LHb value signals were more choice predictive during offer 2 (Fig. 7d–g).

### Whither tobacco product regulation? [^116Tm2Z4]. Tobacco Control (2012). Low credibility.

Despite decades of industry innovation and regulatory efforts, the harmfulness of conventional cigarettes has not changed. There are several pitfalls in this area, including the long time lag before health impacts of product regulatory changes become apparent, the danger of consumers deriving false reassurance of lesser harm in the interim period, the lack of relevant expertise and the lack of an internationally agreed and evidence-based strategic approach. Articles 9 and 10 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provide the potential for such a global strategy, and knowledge and research has increased significantly over recent years. However, there are huge opportunity costs in implementing product disclosure and regulatory strategies: most national regulators have very limited human and financial resources, which should be focused on other evidence-based tobacco control interventions. We believe therefore that it is now time to abandon the notion of safe or safer cigarettes while moving consumers towards cleaner nicotine products as soon as possible. In parallel to this, we recommend a number of other strategies be implemented including: reducing the appeal of all tobacco products, forbidding new tobacco products or brand variants being marketed without evidence of reduced harm, appeal or addictiveness, and developing a tobacco industry resourced, but industry independent, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control global repository to assist national regulators in understanding and regulating the products on their markets.

### Regulating international clinical research: an ethical framework for policy-makers [^111h472X]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Step 3: are the regulatory protections ethically justified, all things considered?

In the final step of our proposed framework, policy-makers should consider whether the given regulatory protections are, all things considered, ethically justified. While step 2 mostly involves descriptive fact-finding, step 3 involves ethical judgement in light of the relevant facts. Specifically, policy-makers should weigh the benefits of the given protections against the costs. They should then consider how these benefits and costs are distributed across different population groups, and to what extent that distribution creates new injustices or exacerbates existing ones — for example, by worsening the lot of the least advantaged in society. Finally, policy-makers should judge whether the costs to individuals or certain groups amount to a violation of their rights or vital moral safeguards, such as the right not to be exposed to risks and burdens that are disproportionate to the potential benefits of the research.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^11682yKS]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Initial gift card preferences

We then inform participants that one in five (that is, 20% of all respondents) who complete the survey will be offered a US$25 gift card from a company of their choice out of six company options. Respondents are asked to rank the six gift card companies on a scale from their first choice (most preferred) to their sixth choice (least preferred). These six companies belong to one of three categories: fast food, food delivery and ride-sharing. All six companies appeared on the misinformation websites in our sample during the past three years (2019–2021), offer items below US$25, and are commonly used throughout the USA. The order in which the six companies are presented is randomized at the respondent level. As a robustness check, we also ask respondents to assign weights to each of the six gift card options. This question gives respondents greater flexibility by allowing them to indicate the possibility of indifference (that is, equal weights) between any set of options. We then ask participants to confirm which gift card they would like to receive if they are selected to ensure they have consistent preferences regardless of how the question is asked. At this initial elicitation stage, the respondents did not know that they will get another chance to revise their choice. Hence, these choices can be thought of as capturing their revealed preference.

Information treatments

All participants in the experiment are given baseline information on misinformation and advertising. This is meant to ensure that all participants in our experiment are made aware of how we define misinformation along with examples of a few misinformation websites (including right-wing, neutral and left-wing misinformation websites), how misinformation websites are identified, and how companies advertise on misinformation websites (via an illustrative example) and use digital platforms to automate placing advertisements.

Participants are then randomized into one control and four treatment groups, in which the information treatments are all based on factual information from our data and prior research. We use an active control design to isolate the effect of providing information relevant to the practice of specific companies on people's behaviour. Participants in the control group are given generic information based on prior research that is unrelated to advertising companies or platforms but relevant to topic of news and misinformation.

### Real-world data for regulatory decision making: challenges and possible solutions for Europe [^115qzEv7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Operational, Technical, and Methodological Challenges

From a European perspective, utilizing RWD is faced with operational, technical, and methodological challenges, but possible solutions exist (Table 1). Operational challenges include feasibility, governance, and sustainability issues, which complicate access to and the routine use of multiple national data sources, many of which will have different legal and ethical requirements for sharing data. As a minimum, appropriate consents and data anonymization techniques are required to ensure data privacy obligation requirements are met; while of paramount importance, current operational processes designed to address obligations may prevent efficient and timely delivery of data, which may be particularly problematic in the context of safety decisions where urgent access to data is needed to inform a regulatory decision.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^113wqKDo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Seppe's limitations and countervailing opportunities

We acknowledge that even if optimally implemented, SEPPE could do nothing to resolve the unavoidable, inherent uncertainties of scientific research, in which even clear answers to intelligent research questions inevitably lead to follow‐on uncertainties and questions and, moreover, the answers themselves may be disappointing. Given the considerable proportion of extensively developed products that fail due to inadequacies in evidence, however, incremental effects to tip potential failures into successes could be sizeable. Although a therapeutic product's performance outcomes cannot be guaranteed at the outset, the quality of the overall plan and individual studies to investigate that performance, should be.

Nor could SEPPE rescue extensively developed therapeutic products that demonstrate unacceptable harms and/or lack of effectiveness/value. More careful, real‐time handling at critical decision points for products that are not achieving their promise, as these become apparent with the accumulating evidence in context with the set product performance parameters, 51 however, has real potential to curtail avoidable, flawed, and inherently expensive late‐stage development. Redistributing stakeholders' time and resources, and advancing these in the development and evaluation cycles could obtain greatest impact and highest efficiency.

Resistance to large scale change, such as SEPPE proposes, could be anticipated due to typical "human nature" implementation barriers, such as overwhelm, conflicting, and/or diverging views and expectations, challenges translating abstract principles into concrete practice, or even basic force of habit. 102 Moreover, this resistance may be magnified by the long‐term investment and commitment across all levels of organizations necessary to develop and implement SEPPE, in what is already a challenging environment replete with rapidly evolving, complex, and expensive change. A notable caveat is that decades of experience with quality approaches in other domains has made clear that "quality is a mindset that impacts everyone and that it is more than a process or programme to be implemented by workers on an assembly line… It is not enough to fix problems after we notice them — the real challenge is to catch them before they happen". 103 In addition, we concede that SEPPE would be unachievable in situations of irretrievably entrenched cultures, where management and staff do not acknowledge the existing weaknesses; introduced quality processes only become part of the problem. 103

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^112LqN2v]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Promotion through research — post-approval marketing via seeding trials and publications strategy is described; these publications have become known as seeding trials and their purpose is often not to advance science but to influence potential prescribers or users, termed marketing in the guise of science, with the intent to familiarize health care clinicians with company products, encourage use over a competing product or generic version, and suggest new applications not covered by current approval and that the company cannot legally advertise. Not uncommonly, companies follow a publications strategy to design and fund several trials to explore off-label uses, and these trials may aim to influence opinion leaders selected as authors, with opportunities frequently accompanied by salary support or payments and additional paid speaking and consulting opportunities.

SAGES guidelines — literature review and key questions for introducing new technology and techniques — report that Seventy relevant articles were identified by the literature search, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were considered the highest quality, the initial review identified very few relevant studies (n = 22), a Google search added an additional 13 relevant articles, and hand searching references yielded (n = 7). Given limited evidence, key questions were developed covering the definition of new technology and procedure, the process to follow during introduction, training requirements, readiness assessment, pre-introduction value criteria, outcomes after introduction to prove safety and effectiveness, consent content, and regulatory requirements. Face-to-face or phone interviews with eight SAGES board members informed a survey for the full SAGES Board, and participants were allowed to make more than one choice in the majority of questions.

### Ancestry testing and the practice of genetic counseling [^114fw4Ha]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2017). Low credibility.

Ancestry testing is a home DNA test with many dimensions; in some cases, the implications and outcomes of testing cross over into the health sphere. Common reasons for seeking ancestry testing include determining an estimate of customer's ethnic background, identifying genetic relatives, and securing a raw DNA data file that can be used for other purposes. As the ancestry test marketplace continues to grow, and third-party vendors empower the general public to analyze their own genetic material, the role of the genetic counselor is likely to evolve dramatically. Roles of the genetic counselor may include assisting clients with the interpretation of and adaptation to these results, as well as advising the companies involved in this sector on the ethical, legal, and social issues associated with testing. This paper reviews the history, fundamentals, intended uses, and unintended consequences of ancestry genetic testing. It also discusses the types of information in an ancestry testing result, situations that might involve a clinical genetic counselor, and the benefits, limitations, and functions that ancestry genetic testing can play in a clinical genetics setting.

### Civil disobedience and abortion services after roe V wade: legal and ethical considerations [^112h98qK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

The future of Roe v Wade is uncertain. If it is overturned, protection of reproductive rights will be determined by the acts of individual state governments, some of which have already signaled that they will ban or severely restrict access to abortion. Health care professionals working in states that maintain the laws that applied in the time before the overturn of Roe may wish to provide assistance-anything from consultation to shipping medications-to women living in more restrictive venues. However, it is important for health care professionals to be aware of the legal consequences of those acts, as well as ethical considerations, when deciding whether to adhere to or to defy laws that they believe threaten the well-being of women. It is likely that legal consequences will vary with the type of act in which a physician engages. This article will review legal considerations, to the extent that they can be known at this point, as well as the ethics of civil disobedience.

### The cigarette market in Brazil: new evidence on illicit practices from the 2019 national health survey [^115mAixw]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore new evidence on illicit practices, such as selling legal brands below the minimum legal price (MLP), and smugglers selling illicit brands at or above the MLP.

Methods

For the first time in Brazil, self-reported information on cigarette brand name and price paid per pack in smokers' last purchase from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2019 was used to distinguish the illicit and the legal markets. We estimated the proportion of illicit cigarette consumption, using the combination of brand and price.

Results

The proportion of smuggled illicit cigarette consumption based on brands not approved on the Brazilian market was estimated at 38.6% (95% CI: 35.8% to 41.5%). When we added legal brands not paying taxes, it increased to 47.1% (95% CI: 44.2% to 49.9%). Around 25% of illicit brand cigarettes were sold at or above MLP.

Conclusions

In Brazil, since 2017 there is a lack of adjustment in tobacco taxes and the MLP for inflation and income growth. The increase in cigarette affordability and the presence on the market of a segment of 'higher-priced' illicit brands suggest patterns of illicit brand loyalty and/or perceived 'brand quality' among smokers of illicit cigarettes. The evidence also shows that a sizeable proportion of legal brand cigarettes were sold below the MLP. This study offers insight into what happened in circumstances in which a government failed to keep current with tax policies and the monitoring of domestic manufacturing. Brazil has been a world leader in the monitoring of the tobacco epidemic, and this study also offers an innovative use of data that an increasing number of countries are collecting.

### How to implement new diagnostic products in low-resource settings: an end-to-end framework [^116fXx4A]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Key stakeholders involved in introducing diagnostic products to low-resource settings

Market research is conducted to better understand the projected growth, size and share of the market(s) in which the product will be sold, how the product will be distributed to the end user, customer needs and preferences and the product's competitive advantage. These activities inform others, such as development of the marketing plan, user-requirements document and the business case. The business case provides evidence to justify the need for the new diagnostic product and why pursuing its development will be a viable business opportunity. Developers also prepare a financial model that provides details around the initial investment cost, projected sales, payback period and breakeven point and other investment performance considerations, such as whether the efforts of developers, are likely to yield an acceptable return on investment. Typically, the business case and financial model are updated throughout the development process as more information becomes available and the decision to continue with development is re-evaluated at the end of each development phase.

### Optimizing household chlorination marketing strategies: a randomized controlled trial on the effect of price and promotion on adoption in Haiti [^111UhSv5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Household water treatment can reduce diarrheal morbidity and mortality in developing countries, but adoption remains low and supply is often unreliable. To test effects of marketing strategies on consumers and suppliers, we randomized 1,798 households in rural Haiti and collected data on purchases of a household chlorination product for 4 months. Households received randomly selected prices ($0.11-$0.56 per chlorine bottle), and half received monthly visits from sales agents. Each $0.22 drop in price increased purchases by 0.10 bottles per household per month (P < 0.001). At the mean price, each 1% drop in price increased purchases by 0.45% (elasticity = 0.45). There is suggestive evidence that household visits by some sales agents increased purchases at mid-range prices; however, the additional revenue did not offset visit cost. Choosing the lowest price and conducting visits maximizes chlorine purchase, whereas slightly raising the retail price and not conducting visits maximizes cost recovery. For the equivalent cost, price discounts increase purchases 4.2 times as much as adding visits at the current retail price. In this context, price subsidies may be a more cost-effective use of resources than household visits, though all marketing strategies tested offer cost-effective ways to achieve incremental health impact. Decisions about pricing and promotion for health products in developing countries affect health impact, cost recovery, and cost-effectiveness, and tradeoffs between these goals should be made explicit in program design.

### A framework to predict the price of energy for the end-users with applications to monetary and energy policies [^114YiA1G]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Energy affects every single individual and entity in the world. Therefore, it is crucial to precisely quantify the "price of energy" and study how it evolves through time, through major political and social events, and through changes in energy and monetary policies. Here, we develop a predictive framework, an index to calculate the average price of energy in the United States. The complex energy landscape is thoroughly analysed to accurately determine the two key factors of this framework: the total demand of the energy products directed to the end-use sectors, and the corresponding price of each product. A rolling horizon predictive methodology is introduced to estimate future energy demands, with excellent predictive capability, shown over a period of 174 months. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by addressing two policy questions of significant public interest.

### Health system governance: a triangle of rules [^1119pRWb]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Notably, the answer may be found among three sets of contextual factors (see the matrix in figure 4): socioeconomic context (eg, inability to afford formal providers means that people would rather 'shop around' at informal providers); geographical context (eg, the large size of the village means there are many informal providers, and for many in the community, it is difficult to physically access a single formal provider); and institutional (ie, rules-in-use) context of the local healthcare market (eg, the constitutional rules to regulate informal providers are neither monitored nor enforced). Interacting with one another, all these contextual factors combine to promote or inhibit the emergence of trust, power and accountability relations, which also strongly influence the choice of provider. When constitutional rules are not monitored and enforced, the rules of the marketplace may dominate at the operational level. Or collective rules may dominate. The collective rules may be a 'professional code' among informal providers such that, even if constitutional rules are neither monitored nor enforced, they may continue to refer to formal providers as appropriate.

Figure 4
The 'matrix' showing 'rules-in-use' as one of three categories of context: rules-in-use are influenced by the three categories of rules, all of which together influence (are, in turn, influenced by) the three categories of context. The three categories of rules influence the three categories of context through how they influence the provision of public goods, the definition and protection of rights, and the facilitation of social exchange.

A strategy to address the problem may be to change existing rules that govern informal providers so that they refer their clients to formal providers or work alongside formal providers. Another may be to spread information about the costs of inappropriate care in the community so people can change their care-seeking behaviours. But these strategies require changing local norms (ie, informal rules), which can take decades to change. A third strategy is to change constitutional rules to enable the supply of more formal providers or reduce out-of-pocket costs of care at formal providers. But these require political engagement strong enough to alter those constitutional rules. A fourth strategy is to improve the monitoring and enforcement of the constitutional rules that limit informal providers. But entrenched local norms and informal practices are hard to regulate at a distance. With a large distance between the constitutional and operational levels, it may be more effective to strengthen collective actors to make new rules or change existing ones in ways they can monitor and enforce.

### To disclose, or not to disclose? Context matters [^1177wN2J]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Although some affirmed the consent process serves primarily as an informational tool to educate prospective participants on the study, others asserted that it absolved, or at least delegated, professional liability elsewhere in cases of IFs:

 — 'I think we have to draw a line at a certain point and say 'You will not get results for this' It's in the consent form, and I think there is a responsibility of the ethics committees to oversee that it's clear to the families'.
Some researchers contended all procedures for handling IF should be disclosed in the consent forms:

 — 'It's got to be decided up front what's in the consent form; and, as far as any data that's collected, it's got to be clearly decided whether the participants will receive or will want to receive the data… And we got to respect that. '

In contrast, others questioned the ethicality of third-party researchers making sweeping decisions about disclosing IFs to families given the implications of receiving this information:

 — 'I know there are some people who definitely want to know these results and there's other patients who do not want to know these results. And, as a researcher, I don't think it's my place to decide whether or not somebody in the family members should'.

Industry payments and prescribing behavior — health care clinicians represent a target audience for industry marketing efforts, and physicians who receive payments for services rendered to the industry tend to prescribe more brand-name drugs than do their colleagues who do not receive such payments. Health care clinicians have an ethical duty to recognize the situations and marketing strategies that are designed to influence their choice of therapeutic options for their patients, and at a minimum, health care clinicians should be aware of the methods used to attempt to affect their behavior and develop strategies to address them.

### Sustainability principle for the ethics of healthcare resource allocation [^112gogRy]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

We will in the following initially keep it undecided exactly what variant of these forms fits best to different specific kinds of allocation decisions and sustainability problems. Likewise, we will initially hold open all further normative details about the weight of the reason for sustainability, and initially assume only that there is some such reason.

The most obvious argument for the inclusion of a sustainability principle is that it would counteract the negative dynamics described in the previous section, avoiding or mitigating the considerable long-term costs that these generate. Such a principle would, for instance, make room for avoiding or reforming patterns of procurement, subsidy and prioritisation that are justified when assessed by the operational principles applied to each specific allocation round, but that pose a long-term economic threat to the efficiency of a healthcare system or systematically favour polluting or fragile pharmaceutical supply chains over cleaner or more secure ones.

The support for sustainability in healthcare resource allocation is furthermore grounded in normative ideals internal to the operational principles that already guide such allocation. Thus, insofar as healthcare systems attach weight to these principles, they should also adopt some version of the sustainability principle. This is perhaps most clearly seen in the case of equal treatment. This principle demands, positively, that patients who are equally situated with respect to relevant considerations (eg, need, prognosis) receive equal shares of resources and, negatively, that nobody is denied an equal share based on any other — arbitrary — consideration. The negative dynamics described in the previous section undermine the application of this normative ideal. This is because they generate a gradual depletion of resources available for meeting health needs and/or a gradual increase of needs to be met over time. At some point, a situation will arise where patients who at time t1 would have received some resource based on their need, prognosis, and so on, will be denied this resource at t2, since the resources available must be devoted to more serious or urgent needs. Patients at t1 and t2 will then have been treated unequally, despite being equal with respect to all relevant considerations. The only difference between them is that they happen to be affected by decisions taken at different times, but, by itself, this temporal distance is morally arbitrary.

### Obesity and advocacy: a joint clinical perspective and expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the obesity action coalition – 2024 [^114BTDVt]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Obesity policy engagement logistics — when advocating to policymakers, the page advises that "Personal face-to-face interactive meetings with elected officials may often be more impactful than communication solely via emails and letters", and to "Introduce yourself (e.g., name, affiliation, location, credentials, qualification)" and "Summarize why the point of advocacy is important to you". Additional guidance includes "Provide a 'real life' example that illustrates the unmet need", "Be prepared to provide key data relevant to your description of the problem, as well as specific citations to support your proposed solution", "Avoid basing the advocacy justification solely on emotional arguments", "Ensure your 'ask' pertains to support for a specific proposed bill or policy", "Provide contact information and express a willingness to address further questions", "Be respectful, courteous, and open to the views of others", "Be honest and forthcoming if you do not know an answer to a question", and "Avoid engaging in personal attacks or displays of condescension/frustration".

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^116MysiJ]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Most participants requested an advertisement check by providing their company name and email address (74%). The demand for an advertisement check was high regardless of respondents' initial beliefs, suggesting a substantial interest in learning about whether their company's advertisements appeared on misinformation websites. Despite only 41% of respondents agreeing that consumers react against companies whose advertisements appear on misinformation websites, most participants (73%) opted to receive information on how consumers respond to companies whose advertisements appear on misinformation websites with 58% inquiring about exit and 15% enquiring about voice. This suggests that although decision-makers may be unaware of how advertising on misinformation websites can provoke consumer backlash, most of them are interested in learning about the degree of potential backlash. Finally, for our most costly revealed-preference measure — that is, signing up to attend a 15-minute expert-led information session on how companies can avoid advertising on misinformation websites — 18% of decision-makers opted to sign up, an arguably high rate given the value of decision-makers' time and the opportunity cost of attending the session.

### Lay of the land: narrative synthesis of tackle research in rugby union and rugby sevens [^113RLirW]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Another strategy to modify player tackle action during matches is through changing the laws of the game. To specifically reduce head injuries during the tackle, the sport's governing body, World Rugby, have recently recommended stronger sanctioning of reckless and high tackles and proposed a reduction in tackle height of a legal tackle, from above the line of the shoulders to above the line of the armpit. These law changes are seemingly based on the behavioural principle known as 'nudging', that is, changing the external environment to achieve a predicable outcome. Changing tackle laws also has a more immediate effect compared with education and training programmes. With that said, the actual effect of these law changes on tackle injury risk and player tackle actions is yet to be published.

Although results from lab-based studies may have limited applicability to match situations due to its controlled nature, studying the tackle in the lab allows for experiential and explorative study designs. Experiential and explorative study designs may offer deeper insights into the demands and movement patterns of the tackle (eg, tackle biomechanics), as well as test the effects of different conditions (eg, physical fatigue) and interventions (video feedback)on tackle technique. Not all research on the tackle needs to have a direct application, and experiential and explorative work is important to inspire innovative tackle injury prevention and performance strategies. Having said that, findings from tackle injury and performance studies in matches, as well stakeholder engagement, should guide the questions and design of lab-based studies.

### Error, blame, and the law in health care – an antipodean perspective [^113YkVEf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients are frequently harmed by problems arising from the health care process itself. Addressing these problems requires understanding the role of errors, violations, and system failures in their genesis. Problem-solving is inhibited by a tendency to blame those involved, often inappropriately. This has been aggravated by the need to attribute blame before compensation can be obtained through tort and the human failing of attributing blame simply because there has been a serious outcome. Blaming and punishing for errors that are made by well-intentioned people working in the health care system drives the problem of iatrogenic harm underground and alienates people who are best placed to prevent such problems from recurring. On the other hand, failure to assign blame when it is due is also undesirable and erodes trust in the medical profession. Understanding the distinction between blameworthy behavior and inevitable human errors and appreciating the systemic factors that underlie most failures in complex systems are essential for the response to a harmed patient to be informed, fair, and effective in improving safety. It is important to meet society's needs to blame and exact retribution when appropriate. However, this should not be a prerequisite for compensation, which should be appropriately structured, fair, timely, and, ideally, properly funded as an intrinsic part of health care and social security systems.

### Legal uncertainty-the gray area around substandard medicines: where public health meets law [^1178iaHn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

A LEGAL LEVERS MATRIX

We propose a "legal levers matrix" to help translate WHO's SF definition into national and international legal frameworks. Although the WHO definition is not per se legally binding, member states can draw from it to adapt their own laws and to harmonize provisions across countries.

To protect individuals and communities from SF medicines, countries should adopt both administrative actions — which do not need to be punitive and can focus on organizational and professional regulation to correct weaknesses in the quality systems — and civil and criminal actions — which may result in liabilities that are retributive and/or compensatory. Civil action may apply in the absence of proven intent, resulting in civil liability for substandard medicines, which is essentially compensatory in character. Criminal action may apply when there is evidence of fraudulent intent or gross negligence (including intentional adoption of risky procedures), resulting in criminal liability for falsified products. Legal levers should apply to natural and legal persons and be commensurate to factors such as severity (e.g. fatal, life-threatening, and long-term sequelae), size (e.g. number of victims) of the harm caused, and nature/size of the potential harm (in case the medicine is detected and confiscated before reaching and harming people).

National systems should be supported by a set of international policies and guidelines oriented toward attaining the sustainable development goals, including UHC. A number of transnational legal and policy frameworks exert an influence over the shaping and implementation of national systems, such as human rights laws, health regulations, and trade agreements among others (Figure 1).

### Impact of gene patents on diagnostic testing: a new patent landscaping method applied to spinocerebellar ataxia [^114i4rxj]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Recent reports in Europe and the United States raise concern about the potential negative impact of gene patents on the freedom to operate of diagnosticians and on the access of patients to genetic diagnostic services. Patents, historically seen as legal instruments to trigger innovation, could cause undesired side effects in the public health domain. Clear empirical evidence on the alleged hindering effect of gene patents is still scarce. We therefore developed a patent categorization method to determine which gene patents could indeed be problematic. The method is applied to patents relevant for genetic testing of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). The SCA test is probably the most widely used DNA test in (adult) neurology, as well as one of the most challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Typically tested as a gene panel covering the five common SCA subtypes, we show that the patenting of SCA genes and testing methods and the associated licensing conditions could have far-reaching consequences on legitimate access to this gene panel. Moreover, with genetic testing being increasingly standardized, simply ignoring patents is unlikely to hold out indefinitely. This paper aims to differentiate among so-called 'gene patents' by lifting out the truly problematic ones. In doing so, awareness is raised among all stakeholders in the genetic diagnostics field who are not necessarily familiar with the ins and outs of patenting and licensing.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^1151CrfF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Tobacco harm reduction research — risk assessment, consent, and fairness are emphasized: "Hazards of prospective population-based evaluations of tobacco harm reduction strategies may qualify as 'greater than minimal risk'. Care should be taken to assess research risks in comparison to current standards of care for reducing harm among people already weary or unwilling to quit, rather than in comparison to the no-intervention condition". "Harm reduction researchers must protect the autonomy of research subjects by discussing the unique nature of the risks of such research with those subjects and by promoting their individual understanding". Autonomy is specified as when participants "have the capacity to understand the risks they are assuming, are given the information necessary to achieve that understanding, have their understanding verified by a researcher qualified to make such an assessment, and consent voluntarily to assume the risks of the research". Unknown risks "must be included in the informed consent discussion", and "the long-term risks of harm reduction methods are not yet fully known — a fact that must be disclosed during the consent process". The policy cautions that "Human subjects may be vulnerable to coercion" and assigns a "particular responsibility of harm reduction investigators to avoid overemphasizing known benefits or minimizing unknown risks", and directs that "Harm reduction researchers should protect research subjects from unforeseen or tragic consequences of their research through fair methods that promote just outcomes", with fairness described as "a uniform process" promoting "the equitable distribution of benefits and harms".

### Considerations in the determination of medical necessity in children: application to contractual language [^117E5CNe]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for medical necessity — evidence standards and expected benefit — state that 'Medically necessary services should be reasonably expected to produce the intended results for children to whom they are delivered and should have expected benefits that outweigh potential harmful effects'. Coverage determinations align with evidence frameworks: 'Evidence-based and evidence-informed practices are widely embraced as appropriate frameworks to guide which health care services should be included in what is covered by a payer or health care agency', and 'Evidence-based practice is rooted in the acquisition and interpretation of scientific evidence'. Evidence hierarchy is specified: 'Robust randomized, controlled clinical trials that demonstrate a salutary effect of the intervention on health outcomes provide the highest level of evidence'; if absent, 'methodologically sound observational studies that support a causal relationship between the intervention and improved health outcomes can be used', whereas 'Less methodologically sound observational studies and uncontrolled clinical series may be suggestive but cannot be used to document a causal salutary relationship unless the magnitude of the effect observed far exceeds what would be expected' given natural history or bias, and 'the amount and quality of available scientific evidence may not always be sufficient to determine the efficacy of a given service or intervention'.

### Illegal experimental tobacco marketplace II: effects of vaping product bans-findings from the 2020 international tobacco control project [^116yYat5]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Some evidence suggests that flavour bans have increased illegal purchases. For example, reports from Massachusettsand San Franciscohave indicated the presence of illegal trade after their flavoured vaping bans. However, prospective analyses of how policies affect illegal e-cigarette purchasing are scarce. Therefore, a scientific understanding of the consequences of regulation on consumer behaviours prior to policy implementation is warranted.

Towards this goal, the Illegal Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (IETM), a modification of the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM), may offer relevant information. The ETM mimics the real-world tobacco marketplacewhere virtual purchases can be made among various tobacco and nicotine products differing in prices, flavours, nicotine concentrationand taxes and subsidies(see Bickel et al for illustrative images of the ETM). The ETM and its extension, the IETM, constitute an experimental model developed to forecast public health policies prior to implementation. As an experimental model, the ETM is not a detailed replication of real-world circumstances, rather a scientific model that can identify some of the core relationships between tobacco and nicotine products and potentially relevant environmental variables. Such initial experimental evidence can prevent or mitigate unintended consequences, which are encountered with considerable frequency. As such, models provide important insights and forecasts that can contribute to the evidentiary basis for policy formation and reform.

- age

- BMI

- pain coping strategies

- report of instability

- history of a previous sprain

- ability to bear weight

- pain with weight bearing

- ankle dorsiflexion ROM

- medial joint-line tenderness

- balance

- ability to jump and land (as safely tolerated).

### SAGES guidelines for the introduction of new technology and techniques [^112yi7qd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

SAGES guidelines — evidence evaluation and oversight for NT&T state that biases during adoption can come from many sources including the patient, surgeon, hospital, society, insurance programs and manufacturers, so an objective evaluation of the existing evidence is necessary to guide surgeons and institutions. While the best evidence (randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews) should always be sought when available, it may not be feasible or realistic to obtain it in a timely fashion and even the best available evidence may not appropriately address all important aspects of NT&T. Therefore, the process of NT&T evaluation is and should be ongoing and does not stop at the time of completion of an HTA; it may be prudent for hospitals to develop dedicated committees that provide oversight of the NT&T introduction process, and these committees should likely be different from the IRB.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^114SkKYZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society tobacco harm reduction claims — validation standards specify: Criteria I through III apply to the specific construction of the claim itself, and criterion IV applies to the development and implementation of the claim. To be considered valid, harm reduction claims must meet all four criteria, specifically that claims of harm reduction must be accompanied by explicit estimates of the anticipated impact on individuals; claims of harm reduction must be accompanied by explicit estimates of the anticipated population-based impact; harm reduction claims must be carefully constructed to explicitly avoid overstatement or misrepresentation; and the investigation and/or regulation of potential harm reduction strategies must pay careful attention to the ethical considerations unique to this concern. The document illustrates that a claim of the form X is healthier than Y would not be considered valid because it fails to explicitly state anticipated effects and uses vague terms.
