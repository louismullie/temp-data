## Question

Medication for thrown out back

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication management for a "thrown-out back", i.e., acute non-specific low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and prognosis. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic options and their evidence. Next, I will examine second-line adjuncts and their risk–benefit profile. After that, I need to check when, if ever, opioids are appropriate and how to minimize harm. Finally, I will integrate nonpharmacologic care, safety screening, and a practical, time-limited plan with monitoring and follow-up, making sure each assertion aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and prognosis so I don't jump to conclusions: a "thrown-out back" typically reflects acute non-specific low back pain, which is common, usually self-limited, and often improves substantially within 4–6 weeks, though recurrences are frequent and a meaningful minority have persistent pain at 3–12 months, so reassurance and activity maintenance are foundational to care [^111nWg8w] [^114Qae8u].

> I need to anchor the pharmacologic hierarchy to current guidelines before recommending anything: major guidelines converge on NSAIDs as first-line when medication is desired, with acetaminophen as an alternative if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated, and they advise against routine opioid use for acute low back pain due to limited benefit and higher harms, which I should double-check against CDC, ACP/AAFP, and VA/DoD statements to ensure alignment [^117CmGep] [^116GQ8q6].

> Now, let me verify NSAID efficacy and magnitude of benefit so expectations are realistic: high-quality evidence shows NSAIDs provide a modest but statistically significant short-term reduction in pain and disability versus placebo, with mean pain reductions around 7–10 points on a 100-point scale and small improvements in function; importantly, the effect size is modest and may not be clinically large for all patients, so I should communicate this clearly [^111o4mKT].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and contraindications before prescribing NSAIDs: gastrointestinal adverse events are increased versus placebo, and cardiovascular and renal risks rise with prolonged or high-dose use, so I need to screen for GI bleeding risk, CV disease, CKD, and drug interactions, and if risk is elevated, consider gastroprotection or an alternative strategy; using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration is prudent and guideline-concordant [^1161BNsL] [^113Lisx3].

> Wait, let me reconsider acetaminophen because I initially thought it was a reliable first-line alternative; the large, high-quality PACE trial found no benefit of regular or as-needed acetaminophen over placebo for acute low back pain, and contemporary VA/DoD guidance concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend acetaminophen, so I should not overstate its role and should position it as a conditional, lower-priority option when NSAIDs are unsuitable [^115d5kkE] [^1136GvEF] [^115rV4m4].

> Next, I should review muscle relaxants as adjuncts for severe spasm or when NSAIDs alone are inadequate: evidence suggests a small, short-term benefit on pain at two weeks or less, but with increased non-serious adverse events such as sedation and dizziness; guidelines variably recommend them, so I will frame them as optional, short-course adjuncts with explicit counseling on drowsiness and falls risk, and I should double-check that benzodiazepines are not recommended due to limited analgesia and higher harms [^113ikMoi] [^114aKFE8] [^1121cUrZ].

> I will now examine topical NSAIDs because they can mitigate systemic risk: for localized non–low back musculoskeletal injuries, guidelines give a strong recommendation for topical NSAIDs as first-line given favorable benefit–harm balance; while most acute low back pain trials focus on systemic agents, topical diclofenac has evidence for acute musculoskeletal pain without increased adverse events versus placebo, so for patients with focal pain and high GI/CV risk, a topical NSAID trial is reasonable, acknowledging the evidence gap for acute low back pain specifically [^1112ppNB] [^116F4iu4].

> But wait, what if pain is severe and the patient is requesting "something stronger"? I need to ensure I don't overreach on opioids: multiple guidelines advise against routine opioid use for acute low back pain because benefits are limited and harms, including GI and neurologic adverse effects and risk of prolonged use, are greater; if, after shared decision-making and failure of nonopioid therapy, a short, as-needed course is used, it should be immediate-release, at the lowest effective dose, for the shortest possible duration with a predefined stop date and close follow-up, and I should document risks, alternatives, and functional goals before prescribing [^117CmGep].

> Let me integrate nonpharmacologic care because medication alone is insufficient: strong recommendations support staying active and avoiding bed rest, and heat therapy provides short-term pain relief and improved flexibility; a small ED RCT suggested similar modest benefit between heat and cold when added to ibuprofen, so patient preference can guide modality, and I should reinforce graded return to usual activities and ergonomics during recovery [^114Qae8u] [^111QCpnD] [^116Pxvzg].

> I should confirm safety screening and monitoring elements so the plan is clinically sound: assess GI, CV, and renal risk before NSAIDs; screen for fall risk and driving needs if considering muscle relaxants; avoid sedative co-prescribing; and arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to reassess pain, function, and adverse effects, with a plan to taper and discontinue medications as symptoms improve to minimize exposure and adverse events [^1161BNsL] [^113Lisx3].

> Putting this together, my practical, time-limited regimen is as follows, and I will double-check each element against guidelines: start with an NSAID such as ibuprofen 400–600 mg every 6–8 hours or naproxen 250–500 mg twice daily for 3–5 days, reassess, and continue only if clearly beneficial and tolerated, using the lowest effective dose; if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider acetaminophen 650–1000 mg every 6 hours as a conditional, lower-efficacy alternative with explicit counseling about limited benefit; if spasm is prominent and function is impaired, add a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant such as cyclobenzaprine 5 mg three times daily for 3–7 days with warnings about sedation; reserve opioids for exceptional cases after shared decision-making, using immediate-release agents at low dose, as needed, for no more than 3–7 days with a predefined end date and close follow-up; and pair all pharmacotherapy with heat, activity encouragement, and ergonomic advice, tapering medications as pain and function improve [^116GQ8q6] [^116f2Vpy] [^117CmGep].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient understands red flags and follow-up: new bowel or bladder dysfunction, progressive neurologic deficits, fever, or severe unremitting pain warrant urgent evaluation; otherwise, arrange reassessment in 1–2 weeks to confirm improvement, adjust therapy, and reinforce self-management, aligning with best-practice guidance for acute low back pain care [^116GQ8q6].

---

For a "thrown out back" (acute low back pain), **NSAIDs are first-line** [^116GQ8q6] (e.g. ibuprofen 400–600 mg every 6–8 hours or naproxen 250–500 mg every 12 hours) to reduce pain and inflammation [^111o4mKT]; use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration [^113Lisx3]. Acetaminophen is a **suitable alternative** [^notfound] if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated, though it is less effective for inflammation [^notfound]. Muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine 5–10 mg three times daily) can be added short-term for severe spasms, but cause sedation and dizziness [^113ikMoi]. Avoid opioids [^117CmGep] unless pain is severe and refractory, and use the lowest dose for ≤ 3 days with close monitoring [^1122rTTF]. Combine with nonpharmacologic care (heat, activity, and physical therapy) [^114Qae8u] and reassess within 1–2 weeks.

## First-line pharmacologic treatments

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- **First-line therapy**: NSAIDs are recommended as first-line pharmacologic treatment for acute low back pain [^116GQ8q6] due to their anti-inflammatory properties and proven efficacy in reducing pain and improving function [^111o4mKT].

- **Common NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen (400–600 mg every 6–8 hours) and naproxen (250–500 mg every 12 hours) are commonly used. Other NSAIDs, such as diclofenac and indomethacin, are also effective but may have higher gastrointestinal (GI) risks [^notfound].

- **Efficacy**: NSAIDs provide modest short-term pain relief and functional improvement in acute low back pain [^111o4mKT].

- **Safety considerations**: NSAIDs increase the risk of GI adverse events (e.g. ulcers, bleeding) [^1129yMgV] and should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible [^113Lisx3]. Patients with GI, cardiovascular, or renal risk factors should use caution [^1167EhT3].

---

### Acetaminophen (paracetamol)

Acetaminophen is a **suitable alternative** [^1167EhT3] for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs due to GI, cardiovascular, or renal risks. It is generally well tolerated but is less effective than NSAIDs for inflammatory pain [^1167EhT3]. Evidence suggests acetaminophen provides minimal benefit for acute low back pain [^113mjy26], though it may be considered for mild pain or when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^1167EhT3].

---

## Adjunctive pharmacologic treatments

### Muscle relaxants

Muscle relaxants are **adjunctive therapy** [^114aKFE8] for acute low back pain, particularly when muscle spasms are present [^116f2Vpy]. Common agents include cyclobenzaprine (5–10 mg three times daily), methocarbamol, and tizanidine. They provide modest short-term pain relief and reduce muscle spasms but are associated with sedation, dizziness, and drowsiness [^113ikMoi]; patients should be cautioned about these effects, especially when driving or operating machinery.

---

### Topical NSAIDs

Topical NSAIDs (e.g. diclofenac gel) are a **localized option** [^1112ppNB] for patients who cannot tolerate oral NSAIDs or prefer topical treatment. They provide modest pain relief with minimal systemic adverse effects, though local skin irritation may occur.

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

### Opioids

Opioids are **not recommended as first-line therapy** [^117CmGep] for acute low back pain due to limited efficacy and significant risks, including addiction, respiratory depression, and overdose [^116zK8WG]. If considered, they should be reserved for severe pain unresponsive to other treatments, prescribed at the lowest effective dose, and used for the shortest duration possible (≤ 3 days) with close monitoring [^1122rTTF].

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are **not recommended** [^1121cUrZ] for acute low back pain due to limited efficacy, high risk of sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependence.

---

### Systemic corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are **not recommended** [^112E25gN] for acute low back pain due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects.

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic treatments should be integrated with pharmacologic therapy [^1122rTTF]:

- **Heat therapy**: Recommended for short-term pain relief and improved function [^111dH9Pd].

- **Physical therapy**: Early mobilization and physical therapy improve pain and function [^1116pifz].

- **Patient education**: Reassurance, activity modification, and ergonomic advice are essential [^112BTsZ6].

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Medication class** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | First-line | High |
| Acetaminophen | Alternative | Moderate |
| Muscle relaxants | Adjunctive | Moderate |
| Topical NSAIDs | Localized option | Moderate |
| Opioids | Reserve for severe cases | Low |
| Benzodiazepines | Not recommended | Low |
| Systemic corticosteroids | Not recommended | Low |

---

NSAIDs are **first-line** for acute low back pain, with acetaminophen as an alternative; muscle relaxants are adjuncts for spasms, and opioids are reserved for severe, refractory cases. Nonpharmacologic care should accompany medications, and treatment should be reassessed within 1–2 weeks.

## References

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^117CmGep]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

For acute low back pain, ACP found insufficient evidence for effectiveness of opioids and recommends nonopioid medications (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain) if choosing pharmacologic treatment. ACP and AAFP suggest against treating patients with acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol. ADA recommends NSAIDs as the first-line therapy for acute pain management (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain). Multiple guidelines that address prescribing for postoperative pain include both nonopioid and opioid treatment options and have emphasized multimodal analgesia, incorporating around-the-clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies and noting that systemic opioids often are needed postoperatively but are not required in all patients. The American Headache Society recommends against prescribing opioid or butalbital-containing medications as first-line treatment for recurrent headache disorders, and the American Academy of Neurology also recommends against use of both of these classes of medications for treatment of migraine, except as a last resort.

Because of equivalent or lesser effectiveness for pain relief compared with NSAIDs and risks for long-term opioid use after using opioids for acute pain, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and only mild postoperative pain (e.g. simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine. Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline evidence base — The network meta-analysis included 207 trials comprising 32 959 patients, with the median of mean patient ages 34.3 years (interquartile range, 28 to 39 years); causes and locations varied across studies (for example, 48% mixed musculoskeletal injuries, 26% sprains, 6% whiplash, 5% muscle strains; 29% isolated ankle injuries, 26% various injuries, 11% neck injuries, 9% upper- and lower-limb injuries, and 7% isolated shoulder injuries), the median average baseline pain was 6.49 cm on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS), and a separate systematic review on predictors of prolonged use included 13 observational studies with 13 263 393 participants.

### Early intervention for acute back injury: can we finally develop an evidence-based approach? [^112GTvrW]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Several reviews of the treatment of acute low back pain have been published in the past and have formed the basis of clinical guidelines. However, these lack consistency in some areas and valid data in others. As the literature in this field has continued to expand, the present review was undertaken to establish whether the guidelines in current use are supported by more recently published, scientifically rigorous research, and whether additional consensus regarding treatment of acute low back injury has been forthcoming in recent years.

Design

A review, and critical analysis, of literature relating to the treatment of acute low back pain that has been published since the production of the currently used clinical guidelines. The guidelines have been reviewed to assess whether their recommendations remain supportable.

Conclusions

Recent research appears to support current clinical guidelines, i.e. exercise may have a positive effect while bed rest is ineffective and may be harmful, simple analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have short-term benefits, and spinal manipulation may be effective in the first four weeks; no evidence was found for traction or back schools. However, we need more randomized controlled trials of treatments shown to be successful with the chronic population, e.g. focused on understanding psychological determinants, and using a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial approach. In the future this may help us to prevent acute low back progressing to the chronic state.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^115jiAnL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute pain — comparative efficacy and recommendation indicates limited benefit and unfavorable safety for opioids. "There were four quality trials of acute pain patients treated with opioids compared with placebo, with a small overall magnitude of benefit, whereas the adverse effects profile was high". Non‑opioid comparators performed as well or better: "Ibuprofen was reportedly superior to codeine or acetaminophen for acute injuries including fractures", "Diflunisal was equivalent to codeine for sprains, strains, and mild-to-moderate LBP", "Valdecoxib was also superior to codeine/acetaminophen for acute LBP treated in emergency departments", and "One trial suggests that transcutaneous electrical stimulation was equivalent to codeine/acetaminophen for acute trauma". The evidence summary states "No quality trials suggest superiority of opioids to other active treatments", and "Quality evidence indicates that safety profiles are considerably worse for opioids". Accordingly, "Routine use of opioids for treatment of acute pain is strongly not recommended and the recommendation for select use of opioids based purely on the evidence is downgraded from 'A' to 'C' (Table 1)". Note that "Valdecoxib is currently withdrawn from the market".

Implementation Considerations

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain (e.g. simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine.
Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g. topical or oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen) and nonpharmacologic (e.g. ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition.
Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.
When diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6).
Clinicians should prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g. hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g. one tablet every 4 hours) and encourage and recommend an opioid taper if opioids are taken around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
If patients already receiving opioids long term require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible and, if additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients meaningfully in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

### Salicylate-containing rubefacients for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^111DE1zu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rubefacients containing salicylates cause irritation of the skin and are believed to relieve various musculoskeletal pains. They are available on prescription, and are common components in over-the-counter remedies. This is an update of a review of rubefacients for acute and chronic pain, originally published in 2009, which found limited evidence for efficacy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topically applied salicylates in acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, from inception to 22 August 2014, together with the Oxford Pain Relief Database, two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials of topical rubefacients containing salicylates to treat musculoskeletal pain in adults, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, and reporting outcomes at close to 7 (minimum 3, maximum 10) days for acute conditions and 14 (minimum 7) days or longer for chronic conditions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit or harm (NNT or NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. We analysed acute and chronic conditions separately.

Main Results

New searches for this update identified one new study that satisfied our inclusion criteria, although it contributed information only for withdrawals. Six placebo- and one active-controlled studies (560 and 137 participants, respectively) in acute pain, and seven placebo- and three active-controlled studies (489 and 182 participants, respectively) in chronic pain were included in the review. All studies were potentially at risk of bias, and there were substantial differences between studies in terms of the participants (for example the level of baseline pain), the treatments (different salicylates combined with various other potentially active ingredients), and the methods (for example the outcomes reported). Not all of the studies contributed usable information for all of the outcomes sought. For the primary outcome of clinical success at seven days in acute conditions (mostly sprains, strains, and acute low back pain), the RR was 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.5) and the NNT was 3.2 (2.4 to 4.9) for salicylates compared with placebo, but this result was not robust (very low quality evidence). Using a random-effects model for analysis the RR was 2.7 (1.05 to 7.0). For the same outcome in chronic conditions (mostly osteoarthritis, bursitis, and chronic back pain), the RR was 1.6 (1.2 to 2.0) and the NNT was 6.2 (4.0 to 13) (very low quality evidence). This result was not substantially changed using a random-effects model for analysis. In both categories there were a number of factors might have influenced the results but sensitivity analysis was limited because of the small number of studies and participants. For both acute and chronic painful conditions any evidence of efficacy came from the older, smaller studies, while the larger, more recent studies showed no effect. Adverse events were more common with salicylate than with placebo but most of the events occurred in only two studies. There was no difference when these studies were removed from the analysis (very low quality evidence). Local adverse events (at the application site) were again more common with salicylate but were nearly all in one study (in which salicylate was combined with another irritant). There was no difference when this study was removed (very low quality evidence). There were insufficient data to draw conclusions against active controls.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence does not support the use of topical rubefacients containing salicylates for acute injuries or chronic conditions. They seem to be relatively well tolerated in the short-term, based on limited data. The amount and quality of the available data mean that uncertainty remains about the effects of salicylate-containing rubefacients.

### Management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114RL3vx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients and clinicians can choose from several treatment options to address acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Purpose

To assess the comparative effectiveness of outpatient treatments for acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries by performing a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to 2 January 2020.

Study Selection

Pairs of reviewers independently identified interventional RCTs that enrolled patients presenting with pain of up to 4 weeks' duration from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Data Extraction

Pairs of reviewers independently extracted data. Certainty of evidence was evaluated by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Data Synthesis

The 207 eligible studies included 32 959 participants and evaluated 45 therapies. Ninety-nine trials (48%) enrolled populations with diverse musculoskeletal injuries, 59 (29%) included patients with sprains, 13 (6%) with whiplash, and 11 (5%) with muscle strains; the remaining trials included various injuries ranging from nonsurgical fractures to contusions. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) proved to have the greatest net benefit, followed by oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen with or without diclofenac. Effects of these agents on pain were modest (around 1 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, approximating the minimal important difference). Regarding opioids, compared with placebo, acetaminophen plus an opioid improved intermediate pain (1 to 7 days) but not immediate pain (≤ 2 hours), tramadol was ineffective, and opioids increased the risk for gastrointestinal and neurologic harms (all moderate-certainty evidence).

Limitations

Only English-language studies were included. The number of head-to-head comparisons was limited.

Conclusion

Topical NSAIDs, followed by oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen with or without diclofenac, showed the most convincing and attractive benefit-harm ratio for patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. No opioid achieved benefit greater than that of NSAIDs, and opioids caused the most harms.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^1121cUrZ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Benzodiazepines

Small trials conducted in the 1970s to 1990s report some effect on acute or chronic low back pain (effect size and level of certainty not reported). Other studies indicate that benzodiazepines do not possess meaningful analgesic properties separate from their sedative properties. A 2017 RCT of 114 patients conducted in the US did not find that that adding diazepam to diclofenac in people attending an emergency department improved functional outcomes or pain at one week. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased falls, cognitive impairment, and risk of addiction.

Non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants

This category of medicine is broad and includes a variety of pharmacologically unrelated medications such as cyclobenzaprine, tolperisone, baclofen, and orphenadrine with similar indications. In both acute and chronic low back pain, there is low and very low certainty evidence that non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants might offer small benefits (mean difference −0.8 (−1.2 to −0.3) from 14 RCTs from the US, Finland, UK, Turkey, and India) but increase the risk of harms, primarily sedation.

Oral corticosteroids

Limited evidence suggests they may be not effective for acute or chronic low back pain (mean difference 0.6 (−2.2 to 1.0) from one RCT conducted in the US), and may not cause harm in short courses.

Cannabinoids

A single RCT of oral cannabidiol in 100 patients conducted in Australia found no effect on low back pain compared with placebo (mean difference −0.3 (−1.3 to 0.6)) and no increase in short term harms in a hyperacute, emergency department setting. There are no data for chronic low back pain, and no data on harms associated with long term use in other chronic conditions.

Oral combination medicines

There is low certainty evidence that combining medicines does not produce superior effect sizes and may increase the risk of harms. An example of combination medicines sometimes used to treat low back pain is an opioid plus an NSAID or paracetamol.

Topical preparations

There is some indirect evidence (level of certainty not assessed) that some formulations of NSAIDS and rubefacients may reduce back pain attributed to muscle strains or sprains more than placebo (effect size not reported), which may apply to some cases of acute low back pain, with no increased risk of harms. There are no data on efficacy for chronic low back pain, but indirect evidence from other chronic pain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis has shown limited effect.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111gH39n]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — opioid therapy in acute presentations: For patients with acute low back pain or acute exacerbations of chronic low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of time-limited opioid therapy, and any opioid therapy should be kept to the shortest duration and lowest dose possible.

---

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^116Nvd2H]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute pain (up to 4 weeks) — recommended measures include comprehensive history and physical; opioids for treatment of acute, severe pain uncontrolled by other agents with functional deficits, with allowance that they may be indicated at the initial visit for a brief course when anticipated pain accompanies severe injuries, and that a Schedule IV opioid may be indicated when alternatives are not usable; the panel states, "Recommend to taper off opioid use in 1 to 2 weeks". Screening should be intensified for patients "requiring continuation of opioids beyond 2 weeks", and discontinuation is advised after meaningful functional recovery; for opioid-naive patients on continuous opioids, those "over 50-mg MED for longer than 3 weeks' duration may benefit from brief tapering over 3 to 7 days". Items not recommended include "Acute or chronic opioid use for patients who perform safety-sensitive jobs" and "Routine opioid use for treatment of nonsevere acute pain (eg, LBP, sprains, or minor injury without signs of tissue damage)".

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^115yUYrp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines using GRADE — Certainty of evidence definitions are as follows: High, "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect". Moderate, "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different". Low, "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Strength of recommendations: Strong indicates "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa" and "Applies to most patients in most circumstances" with policy implication that "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs". Conditional indicates "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty" and "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", with policy implications that "Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^111o4mKT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Medications for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society / American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1133gQ9t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Medications are the most frequently prescribed therapy for low back pain. A challenge in choosing pharmacologic therapy is that each class of medication is associated with a unique balance of risks and benefits.

Purpose

To assess benefits and harms of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, tramadol, and systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain).

Data Sources

English-language studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE (through November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts.

Study Selection

Systematic reviews and randomized trials of dual therapy or monotherapy with 1 or more of the preceding medications for acute or chronic low back pain that reported pain outcomes, back-specific function, general health status, work disability, or patient satisfaction.

Data Extraction

We abstracted information about study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. To grade methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for individual trials.

Data Synthesis

We found good evidence that NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain) are effective for pain relief. The magnitude of benefit was moderate (effect size of 0.5 to 0.8, improvement of 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analogue pain scale, or relative risk of 1.25 to 2.00 for the proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant pain relief), except in the case of tricyclic antidepressants (for which the benefit was small to moderate). We also found fair evidence that opioids, tramadol, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin (for radiculopathy) are effective for pain relief. We found good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective. Adverse events, such as sedation, varied by medication, although reliable data on serious and long-term harms are sparse. Most trials were short term (≤ 4 weeks). Few data address efficacy of dual-medication therapy compared with monotherapy, or beneficial effects on functional outcomes.

Limitations

Our primary source of data was systematic reviews. We included non-English-language trials only if they were included in English-language systematic reviews.

Conclusions

Medications with good evidence of short-term effectiveness for low back pain are NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain). Evidence is insufficient to identify one medication as offering a clear overall net advantage because of complex tradeoffs between benefits and harms. Individual patients are likely to differ in how they weigh potential benefits, harms, and costs of various medications.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115oPAgu]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-network meta-analysis (PRISMA-NMA) statement for this article. This report is part of a larger project (PROSPERO CRD42019145257) evaluating analgesic medicines for low back pain. The published protocol appears in supplement 1, and protocol updates are in supplement 2a and 2b.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults (≥ 18 years) with acute non-specific low back pain. We included randomised controlled trials that compared an analgesic medicine with another analgesic medicine, placebo medicine, or no treatment (including continuation of usual care or being placed on a waitlist). We did not restrict our criteria by language or publication status. We excluded randomised controlled trials with enriched enrolment because this method violates the transitivity assumption.

We included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids from the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system (supplement 2c). Medicines must have had a license for use in humans in 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration, UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, European Medicines Agency, or Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. We included additional licensed medicines in these classes that were identified during the review process. Medicines must have been administered systemically (eg, oral, intravenous, and intramuscular) as a single drug or combination formulations, at any dose. We excluded non-systemic administrations (eg, topical and epidural). Trials that used non-pharmacological co-interventions were included and were considered in the assessment of transitivity.

We only included trials that assessed the effects of medicines that had been administered for a minimum of 24 h or, where single administration was used, outcomes at the end of treatment had to have been measured a minimum of 24 h later. This threshold excluded trials that tested the analgesic effect of medicines on immediate term outcomes only, which typically examined acute emergency care or experimental settings and is different to primary care.

Data sources

We searched five electronic databases and three clinical trial registers (Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform) from database inception until 20 February 2022. Full search strategies appear in supplement 2d. We also searched previous reviews and reference lists of included trials, which returned no additional records.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^1136v7X9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ultimately, understanding the balance between benefits and harms of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions is a key step to better serving people with NS-LBP. After first line of care, NS-LBP should be managed with non-pharmacological treatments which seem to mitigate pain and disability in the first week. Among pharmacological interventions, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants appear to offer the best net balance at immediate-term for pain and disability.

What is already known

Non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide.
Among the therapeutic interventions for NS-LBP, it is not clear which intervention offers the best benefit–harm balance.
Uncertainty in the management of NS-LBP is reflected in the often discordant guideline recommendations.

What are the new findings

Among non-pharmacological interventions, pain and disability reduction were best achieved by heat wrap, manual therapy and exercise at immediate-term of follow-up.
Among pharmacological interventions, pain and disability reduction were best achieved by NSAIDs and muscle relaxants at immediate-term of follow-up.
Paracetamol had no benefit over inert treatments at any follow-up assessment; evidence was largely uncertain.

### Heat or cold packs for neck and back strain: a randomized controlled trial of efficacy [^116Pxvzg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute back and neck strains are very common. In addition to administering analgesics, these strains are often treated with either heat or cold packs. The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of heat and cold in relieving pain from back and neck strains. The authors hypothesized that pain relief would not differ between hot and cold packs.

Methods

This was a randomized, controlled trial conducted at a university-based emergency department (ED) with an annual census of 90,000 visits. ED patients > 18 years old with acute back or neck strains were eligible for inclusion. All patients received 400 mg of ibuprofen orally and then were randomized to 30 minutes of heating pad or cold pack applied to the strained area. Outcomes of interest were pain severity before and after pack application on a validated 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain), percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesia, subjective report of pain relief on a verbal rating scale (VRS), and future desire for similar packs. Outcomes were compared with t-tests and chi-square tests. A sample of 60 patients had 80% power to detect a 15-mm difference in pain scores.

Results

Sixty patients were randomized to heat (n = 31) or cold (n = 29) therapy. Mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 37.8 (± 14.7) years, 51.6% were female, and 66.7% were white. Groups were similar in baseline patient and pain characteristics. There were no differences between the heat and cold groups in the severity of pain before (75 mm [95% CI = 66 to 83] vs. 72 mm [95% CI = 65 to 78]; p = 0.56) or after (66 mm [95% CI = 57 to 75] vs. 64 mm [95% CI = 56 to 73]; p = 0.75) therapy. Pain was rated better or much better in 16/31 (51.6%) and 18/29 (62.1%) patients in the heat and cold groups, respectively (p = 0.27). There were no between-group differences in the desire for and administration of additional analgesia. Twenty-five of 31 (80.6%) patients in the heat group and 22 of 29 (75.9%) patients in the cold group would use the same therapy if injured in the future (p = 0.65).

Conclusions

The addition of a 30-minute topical application of a heating pad or cold pack to ibuprofen therapy for the treatment of acute neck or back strain results in a mild yet similar improvement in the pain severity. However, it is possible that pain relief is mainly the result of ibuprofen therapy. Choice of heat or cold therapy should be based on patient and practitioner preferences and availability.

CONCLUSIONS

Balancing comfort and patient safety following acute musculoskeletal injury is possible when using a true multimodal approach including cognitive, physical, and pharmaceutical strategies. In this document, we attempt to provide practical, evidence-based guidance for clinicians in both the operative and nonoperative settings to address acute pain from musculoskeletal injury. We also organized and graded the evidence to both support recommendations and identify gap areas for future research.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116PYyqQ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Results

We identified 154 eligible records corresponding to 124 eligible trials. Twenty six trial registrations were noted as terminated, ongoing, or unknown. Therefore, we included 98 randomised controlled trials published between 1964 and 2021 (fig 1). The 1300 records excluded during full text screening are provided in supplement 2e. The 98 included trials (n = 15 134 participants) evaluated 70 unique interventions (69 medicines or combinations, and placebo; supplement 2f). No trials included a no treatment group.

Fig 1
Flow diagram of study identification, screening, and inclusion

Participant characteristics (table 1) reflected typical acute non-specific low back pain populations: 49% women, mean age mostly between 30 and 60 years, low back pain duration ranged from 24 h to 21 days, and median pain intensity at baseline of 65/100 (interquartile range 57–72) across included trials. Thirty eight (39%) of 98 trials were placebo controlled, 66 trials (67%) masked both participants and clinicians, and 40 trials (41%) reported industry sponsorship. Analyses on industry sponsorship are reported in supplement 2. Characteristics about participants, interventions, and outcomes are available in supplement 2g and 2h. Characteristics about trial registrations noted as terminated, ongoing, or unknown are available in supplement 2i.

Table 1
Summary of studies included in the review

Forty two medicines were administered as a monotherapy and 27 as combinations (supplement 2f). Treatment duration ranged from one day (single administration) to 42 days. Eighty (82%) of 98 trials administered medicines orally, and 168 (98%) of 172 medicines were administered within a standard or licensed dosing range (table 1). Two trialsreported two or more intervention groups within the same dosing range that we combined.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^1171ZPA5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Acute non–low back musculoskeletal injury pain — opioid therapy, including tramadol — is linked to a conditional recommendation with low-certainty evidence, and evidence shows limited short-term benefit with meaningful harms: high-certainty evidence showed acetaminophen plus opioids reduced pain at 1 to 7 days and also at less than 2 hours (the latter small and not clinically important), while moderate- to high-certainty evidence indicated opioid interventions were associated with large increases in risk for neurologic and GI adverse effects; observational data show continued prescription opioid use over the long term in 27% among high-risk populations and 6% among the general population, with longer prescription periods (> 7 days vs 1 to 3 days) and higher morphine milligram equivalents per day predicting prolonged use.

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^112QNZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of health care providers. Practical information is required to assist health care providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained. This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^1167EhT3]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs. Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g., muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

### Properties of thermal analgesia in a human chronic low back pain model [^111Dumeh]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For thousands of years, heat has provided comfort and pain relief. Recently, heat as a nonpharmacological approach to pain management has become a key part of treatment guidelines, including the Clinical Guidelines for the American College of Physicianswhich states as part of the first recommendation, "… clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat… " Yet, a Cochrane Review by French et al 2006pointed out that in spite of the frequent use of heat and clinical guidelines, there is a paucity of good studies demonstrating the effectiveness of heat in treating a condition as common as acute low back pain and even less information on treating chronic low back pain. The issues identified limiting the understanding of heat's pain-relieving abilities, are related to the study methodology and questions about randomization, blinding, and composition of treatment groups.

In their review, French et al (2006)identified four published trials judged as a higher quality based on their methodology using heat in low back pain. Nadler et al (2002)compared a chemical heat wrap to oral placebos, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen in subjects with acute to subacute (3 months or less) low back pain. The heat wrap provided up to 8 hours of 40°C heat produced by a chemical oxidation reaction. The heat wrap produced superior pain relief when compared to both ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Similar studies in acute low back pain (< 3 months) found superior pain relief compared to oral placebo or ibuprofen when the wraps were used overnight as well over a 5-day period. Nuhr et al (2004)evaluated heat provided by electrical blankets in subjects with acute low back pain to treatment with an unheated blanket. The heated electrical blanket produced significantly greater pain relief than an unheated blanket alone. Finally, Mayer et al (2005)found that hot chemical packs in acute back pain combined with exercise were better than either intervention alone. More recent studies also support the use of heat to relieve pain in neck and back strain, knee pain, dysmenorrhea, and delayed muscle soreness related to exercise.

### A comprehensive review of clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of drugs for the treatment of low back pain [^1115m7jT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

A systematic review involving 50 randomized controlled trials (4,863 patients) published since 1980 was undertaken with the objective of assessing efficacy and safety of low back pain (LBP) medications. The methodological quality of each trial was evaluated based on a standardized system. Quality scores ranged from 26 to 82 points on a 100-point scale (from 0 to 100), indicating an overall moderate quality of the trials reviewed. Limited evidence was found regarding the effectiveness of drug treatments for LBP and current studies focused on short-term usage of the therapies. Available evidence supported the effectiveness of non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in acute and chronic LBP, of muscle relaxants in acute LBP, and of antidepressants in chronic LBP; safety results were heterogeneous. More rigorously designed trials should be implemented to establish comparative efficacy and safety of drugs used to treat chronic and acute LBP.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1149ecU5]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Ninety two trials reported measuring safety, but only 68 trials (74%) were analysed for the number of participants who reported an adverse event. The primary reasons for data unavailability were reports of only numbers of adverse events, rather than number of participants, or no data for the subset of participants with acute non-specific low back pain. Nine trials were at low risk of bias, 41 trials had some concerns, and 18 trials were at high risk of bias (supplement 2r). One network compared 55 interventions (54 medicines and placebo) in 66 trials (fig 5), and two trials did not connect to the network. All comparisons in the network consisted of a one or two trials and the number of closed loops was small. Direct evidence was available for 70 (4.7%) of 1485 comparisons. Effect estimates were analysed as risk ratios.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of low back pain [^111PBmET]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is amongst the top ten most common conditions presenting to primary care clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Further, it accounts for a significant amount of health care expenditure; indeed, over one third of all disability dollars spent in the United States is attributable to low back pain. In most cases, acute low back pain is a self-limiting disease. There are many evidence-based guidelines for the management of LBP. The most common risk factor for development of LBP is previous LBP, heavy physical work, and psychosocial risk factors. Management of LBP includes identification of red flags, exclusion of specific secondary causes, and comprehensive musculoskeletal/neurological examination of the lower extremities. In uncomplicated LBP, imaging is unnecessary unless symptoms become protracted. Reassurance that LBP will likely resolve and advice to maintain an active lifestyle despite LBP are the cornerstones of management. Medications are provided not because they change the natural history of the disorder, but rather because they enhance the ability of the patient to become more active, and in some cases, to sleep better. The most commonly prescribed medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants. Although NSAIDs are a chemically diverse class, their similarities, efficacy, tolerability, and adverse effect profile have more similarities than differences. The most common side effects of NSAIDs are gastrointestinal. Agents with cyclo-oxygenase 2 selectivity are associated with reduced gastrointestinal bleeding, but problematic increases in adverse cardiovascular outcomes continue to spark concern. Fortunately, short-term use of NSAIDs for LBP is generally both safe and effective. This review will focus on the role of NSAIDs in the management of LBP.

### Nicoboxil / nonivamide cream effectively and safely reduces acute nonspecific low back pain-a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^114iUQEX]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations of the presented study include no evaluation of durability of endpoints beyond several days for a more prolonged use of the nicoboxil/nonivamide cream.

What other treatment options for acute low back pain exist? In a review of national and international clinical low back pain guidelines, one of the common recommendations is that patients should stay as active as possible and gradually increase their activity levels (including returning to work even in the presence of back pain). Regarding pharmacological treatment options, the guidelines recommend paracetamol as first choice analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in case paracetamol would not work. All of these drugs require systemic application.

In the meantime, some interesting relevant new studies and reviews have been published. Remarkably, a large clinical study on acute low back pain run in Australia did report no treatment effect for paracetamol in comparison to placebo. A meta-analysis of treatments for nonspecific low back pain found only small effects of NSAIDs (using their categories, nicoboxil/nonivamide would have been rated having "large treatment effects"). This was confirmed by another meta-analysis investigating the effects of over-the-counter medications for acute low back pain. The centrally acting muscle-relaxant cyclobenzaprine has been shown to be effective; however, up to 68% of the patients reported drowsiness as adverse event.NSAIDs (lornoxicam and diclofenac at prescription only doses) provided some acute low back pain relief. Besides the fact that systemic treatments have not provided a pronounced pain relief, one should bear in mind that agents such as NSAIDs or centrally acting muscle analgesics are prone to cause systemic adverse effects, which might limit their use. Such adverse effects are less likely to occur with topical treatments like the one investigated in this study.

Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain

Many acute pain conditions often can be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications. A systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, topical NSAIDs provided the greatest benefit-harm ratio, followed by oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen with or without diclofenac. NSAIDs have been found to be more effective than opioids for surgical dental pain and kidney stone pain and similarly effective to opioids for low back pain. Evidence is limited on comparative effectiveness of therapies for acute neuropathic pain, neck pain, and postoperative pain. For episodic migraine, triptans, NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists (gepants), and lasmiditan are associated with improved pain and function with usually mild and transient adverse events.

ACP recommends NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants if pharmacologic treatment is desired to treat low back pain. For acute musculoskeletal injuries other than low back pain, ACP and AAFP recommend topical NSAIDs with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy and suggest oral NSAIDs to relieve pain or improve function or oral acetaminophen to reduce pain. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends NSAIDs as first-line treatment for acute dental pain management. For acute kidney stone pain, NSAIDs are at least as effective as opioids, can decrease the ureteral smooth muscle tone and ureteral spasm causing kidney stone pain, and are preferred for kidney stone pain if not contraindicated. Triptans, NSAIDs, combined triptans with NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, and acetaminophen are established acute treatments for migraine. Lasmiditan, an 5-HT1F receptor agonist, and ubrogepant, a gepant, were approved by FDA in 2019 for the treatment of migraine; another gepant, rimegepant, was approved in 2020. Lasmiditan and the gepants were more effective than placebo in providing pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week. Adverse events related to these newer medications require further study; however, their mechanisms of action are believed to be nonvasoconstrictive and potentially carry lower risks than vasoactive medications in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) acute musculoskeletal pain guideline — evidence review scope and methods: The key question was, "In adult patients with acute (< 4 weeks), non–low back, musculoskeletal pain in the outpatient setting, what are the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms, both short-term and long-term) of nonpharmacologic treatments, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and opioid treatments?" An additional review asked, "What factors are associated with prolonged opioid use after prescription to treat acute musculoskeletal pain in adults?" Reviewers searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, and CENTRAL from inception through February 2018, assessed risk of bias, and studied adults with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries; interventions included both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, were compared versus placebo and versus each other, and outcomes included pain at 15 minutes to 2 hours, 1 to 7 days, and 3 weeks to 6 months, function, symptom relief, patient satisfaction, and GI, dermatologic, and neurologic adverse events.

### Medications for treating low back pain in adults. evidence for the use of paracetamol, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants: an overview for musculoskeletal clinicians [^117XoF56]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Because pharmacological therapies may play an important role in managing musculoskeletal pain, the appropriate use of medicines for common conditions like low back pain (LBP) is critical. New evidence on the effects and safety of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants for LBP warrants an updated overview for musculoskeletal clinicians on this topic.

Clinical Question

How effective and safe are paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants compared with placebo for treating LBP?

Key Results

For acute LBP (< 12 weeks), muscle relaxants and NSAIDs may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but the effects of opioids, antibiotics, and antidepressants are unknown. Paracetamol provides no additional benefit for acute LBP. For chronic LBP (> 12 weeks), NSAIDs, antidepressants, and opioids may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but opioids have an established profile of harms. Antibiotics may also reduce pain for people with chronic LBP with Modic type 1 changes, although the risks may outweigh their benefits. The effects of paracetamol and muscle relaxants for chronic LBP were unclear.

Clinical Application

NSAIDs may have a role in managing acute and chronic LBP, with cautious use in people who may be at greater risk of experiencing adverse events. Paracetamol, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and antidepressants should only be prescribed following a discussion between the treating clinician and the patient, considering the risks and possible benefits, and after or in conjunction with recommended nonpharmacological strategies for improving LBP.

### Overview of available treatments and their limitations for hypertrophic facet joints – A systematic review of the literature [^113UmViH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Treatments and Limitations

Lower back pain can have three sources. The first source is axial lumbosacral pain, which arises from the lumbar (L1–5), sacral (S1), and sacrococcygeal junction vertebral regions. The second, radicular pain originates from a dorsal root ganglion irritation and then travels down an extremity following dermatome innervation. The third is referred pain, which is pain that travels to a region distant from the source, it does not follow dermatome innervation. Lower back pain being the leading contributor to disability and workdays lost, many treatments have been established.

In an acute setting, treatments for lower back pain include pharmacological and nonpharmacological options. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are considered the best treatment in an acute setting. Topical patches and creams can also provide some amelioration to the pain. Heat and cold therapy can alleviate symptoms of facet joints syndrome because they increase blood circulation by dilating vessels and relaxing muscles or constricting vessels to reduce inflammation, respectively. Under the guidance of a physical therapist, physical therapy and exercise can also aid in lowering back pain by speeding the healing process. By having good posture and knowing how to stretch the lower extremities, abdomen, and back muscles, a patient can speed the healing process. Another option in an acute setting is a mechanical back brace. By using a brace, it forces the vertebral column to remain upright in orthostasis and orthopneic positions while limiting torsion, bending, and any other movements that may contribute to the pain.

In a chronic setting, the treatment of lower back pain requires more potent pharmacotherapeutics. If pain is severe and unresponsive to conservative medications, patients are prescribed opioids. Opioids are highly addictive and should be given in a time-limited course with constant monitoring of the patient to assess the efficacy of the treatment; they should not be given to patients at risk for addiction or abnormal behavior. For short-term treatment of back pain. An epidural steroid facet injection can also be given to a patient; it is a useful tool to diagnose and treat a patient with facet joint syndrome; the injection typically includes an anesthetic or an anesthetic with a combination of steroids. Another type of injection is a medical branch injection; it is applied near branch nerves and reduces nerve fiber permeability, blood flow to nerves, and pain signals from the nerve to the brain.

### Low back pain (acute) [^111nWg8w]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point in their lives. Acute low back pain can be self-limiting; however, 1 year after an initial episode, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. Acute low back pain has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may increase in severity and duration over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for acute low back pain? What are the effects of local injections for acute low back pain? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for acute low back pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 49 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics (paracetamol, opioids), back exercises, back schools, bed rest, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, epidural corticosteroid injections, lumbar supports, massage, multidisciplinary treatment programmes, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), spinal manipulation, temperature treatments (short-wave diathermy, ultrasound, ice, heat), traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

### Diagnosis and treatment of low-back pain because of paraspinous muscle spasm: a physician roundtable [^112584zn]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines to diagnose and treat acute low-back pain, practical application is nonuniform and physician uncertainty regarding best practices is widespread.

Objective

The objective of this study was to further optimal treatment choices for screening, diagnosing, and treating acute low-back pain caused by paraspinous muscle spasm.

Methods

Four experts in pain medicine (three family physicians and one physiatrist) participated in a roundtable conference call on October 18, 2010, to examine current common practices and guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute low-back pain and to offer commentary and examples from their clinical experience.

Results

Participants discussed the preferred choices and timing of diagnostic and imaging tests, nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid and opioid medication use, biopsychosocial evaluation, complementary therapies, and other issues related to treatment of acute low-back pain. Principal clinical recommendations to emerge included thorough physical exam and medical history, early patient mobilization, conservative use of imaging tests, early administration of muscle relaxants combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and spasm, and a strong emphasis on patient education and physician-patient communication.

Conclusions

Early, active management of acute low-back symptoms during the initial onset may lead to better patient outcomes, reducing related pain and disability and, possibly, preventing progression to chronicity.

### Efficacy of paracetamol for acute low-back pain: a double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^115d5kkE]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Regular paracetamol is the recommended first-line analgesic for acute low-back pain; however, no high-quality evidence supports this recommendation. We aimed to assess the efficacy of paracetamol taken regularly or as-needed to improve time to recovery from pain, compared with placebo, in patients with low-back pain.

Methods

We did a multicentre, double-dummy, randomised, placebo controlled trial across 235 primary care centres in Sydney, Australia, from Nov 11, 2009, to March 5, 2013. We randomly allocated patients with acute low-back pain in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive up to 4 weeks of regular doses of paracetamol (three times per day; equivalent to 3990 mg paracetamol per day), as-needed doses of paracetamol (taken when needed for pain relief; maximum 4000 mg paracetamol per day), or placebo. Randomisation was done according to a centralised randomisation schedule prepared by a researcher who was not involved in patient recruitment or data collection. Patients and staff at all sites were masked to treatment allocation. All participants received best-evidence advice and were followed up for 3 months. The primary outcome was time until recovery from low-back pain, with recovery defined as a pain score of 0 or 1 (on a 0–10 pain scale) sustained for 7 consecutive days. All data were analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, number ACTN 12609000966291.

Findings

550 participants were assigned to the regular group (550 analysed), 549 were assigned to the as-needed group (546 analysed), and 553 were assigned to the placebo group (547 analysed). Median time to recovery was 17 days (95% CI 14–19) in the regular group, 17 days (15–20) in the as-needed group, and 16 days (14–20) in the placebo group (regular vs placebo hazard ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.87–1.14; as-needed vs placebo 1.05, 0.92–1.19; regular vs as-needed 1.05, 0.92–1.20). We recorded no difference between treatment groups for time to recovery (adjusted p = 0.79). Adherence to regular tablets (median tablets consumed per participant per day of maximum 6; 4.0 [IQR 1.6–5.7] in the regular group, 3.9 [1.5–5.6] in the as-needed group, and 4.0 [1.5–5.7] in the placebo group), and number of participants reporting adverse events (99 [18.5%] in the regular group, 99 [18.7%] in the as-needed group, and 98 [18.5%] in the placebo group) were similar between groups.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that regular or as-needed dosing with paracetamol does not affect recovery time compared with placebo in low-back pain, and question the universal endorsement of paracetamol in this patient group.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^116zK8WG]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — opioid therapy states that the Work Group issued a weak recommendation against the use of opioids for chronic LBP, concluding that the potential harms of opioids outweigh the potential benefits in patients with LBP and that the available evidence was only 15 weeks. Trials included in the systematic reviews did not assess the risks of long-term opioid use, and risks such as opioid use disorder and overdose increase with longer duration and higher dosage but may occur even at low opioid dosage and short-term use. For acute LBP or acute exacerbation of chronic LBP, the Work Group decided to not make a recommendation regarding the short-term use of opioids because no clinical trials evaluated time-limited (less than seven days) therapy. In a study not included in the evidence base that extends to 12 months, treatment with opioids was not superior to non-opioid medications for improving pain-related function over 12 months (overall p = 0.58), pain intensity was slightly but significantly better in the non-opioid group (overall p = .03), and adverse medication-related symptoms were more common in the opioid group over 12 months (overall p = .03).

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111iD1uK]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain represents a major public health problem worldwide,–with chronic pain affecting approximately 27% of the adult population in Europeand more than 100 million adults in the United States. Undertreated acute pain can be associated with an increased risk of deleterious health consequences (eg, delayed wound healing, immune dysfunction, cardiovascular problems related to the stress response, and respiratory problems, such as pneumonia) and the development of chronic pain. In addition, unrelieved chronic severe pain can negatively impact an individual's quality of life, day-to-day functioning, sleep quality, interpersonal relationships, and work productivity, and is associated with a substantial economic burden.

There are two major options for the pharmacological management of pain: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, and opiate/opioid analgesics.NSAIDs, which are among the most widely used medications worldwide, are often preferred because of their low abuse potential, robust efficacy, and long history of clinical use. Guidelines for pain management tend to be specific to medical conditions or settings. Current guidelines for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis generally recommend the use of oral acetaminophen (or topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritis) for first-line pain management, with other oral NSAIDs recommended in the first-line or second-line setting depending on the specific guideline; some guidelines also recommend opioids, although typically not as first-line therapy.–It has, however, recently been shown that acetaminophen is not measurably effective in acute low back pain (ie, not more effective than placebo). Other work in patients with osteoarthritis demonstrated that ibuprofen was associated with greater improvements compared with acetaminophen in measures of osteoarthritis pain, function, and quality of life. Acetaminophen and other oral NSAIDs are also recommended for acute pain, such as postoperative pain management.

Chronic noncancer pain — opioid trial scope and outcomes indicate many short-duration studies, lack of functional benefit, and comparative alternatives. There are 67 high- or moderate-quality double-controlled clinical trials; of these, 52% lasted up to 1 month, 12% were 1 to 2 months, and 34% were 3 months in duration, with only one trial longer than 3 months at 16 weeks. Only one quality trial targeted subacute pain, finding flupirtine equivalent to tramadol for subacute LBP. No quality trials suggest superiority of opioids to other medications or treatments, and there are no trials documenting improved objective functional outcomes, with more than 100 studies documenting many adverse effects; there is quality evidence that opioids are associated with reduced pain thresholds.

### Nicoboxil / nonivamide cream effectively and safely reduces acute nonspecific low back pain-a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^117VSae8]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a widespread ailment and the leading cause of activity limitation and work absence globally, causing more global disability than any other condition.

Data from the European Health surveys show a wide variation in the prevalence of self-reported low back pain. It is estimated that 12%–30% of adults have low back pain at any time and the lifetime prevalence varies between 60% and 85%. One year prevalence is reported to be up to 82%. The results of a recent World Health Organization epidemiological study on the risk factors and disability associated with low back pain in adults aged ≥ 50 years from six developing countries have shown that the prevalence was highest in the Russian Federation (56%).

Usually, acute low back pain is nonspecific, self-limiting, and with a high percentage of remission within 6 weeks. Nevertheless, low back pain accounts for high direct costs associated with clinical diagnostics and therapy as well as high indirect costs due to the inability to work.

Medical intervention can reduce the risk of chronification and support the patients until the remission of pain, increasing their quality of life.

An analysis of national and international guidelines for the treatment of low back pain identified as common practice the need to inform the patient and the advice on staying as active as possible. Recommended medication consists of paracetamol as the first option and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as the second option, with varying guideline recommendations on other treatment options such as opioids, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or capsaicin.

A recent study by Williams et al concluded that paracetamol did not improve low back pain.

Clinical evidences of the efficacy of the treatments for acute nonspecific low back pain are scarce and inconsistent. In this context, topically applied, locally acting treatments could be an attractive alternative to the systemic medication, reducing the risk of side effects and drug interactions.

### Nonsurgical management of acute and chronic low back pain [^112BTsZ6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

A variety of nonsurgical treatment alternatives exists for acute and chronic low back pain. Patients should receive appropriate education about the favorable natural history of low back pain, basic body mechanics, and methods (eg, exercises, activity modification, behavioral modification) that can reduce symptoms. Nonprescription medication is efficacious for mild to moderate pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alone or in combination with muscle relaxants, relieve pain and improve overall symptoms of acute low back pain. Exercise therapy has limited value for acute low back pain, but strong evidence supports exercise therapy in the management of chronic low back pain. Moderately strong evidence supports the use of manipulation in acute back pain. Evidence is weak for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with acute low back pain, strong for short-term relief of chronic low back pain, and limited for long-term relief of chronic low back pain. The use of facet injections in the management of acute low back pain is not supported by evidence, nor is the effectiveness of orthoses, traction, magnets, or acupuncture. Trigger point injections are not indicated for nonspecific acute or chronic low back pain, and sacroiliac joint injections are not indicated in the routine management of low back pain. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

### Paracetamol for low back pain [^113mjy26]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Analgesic medication is the most frequently prescribed treatment for low back pain (LBP), of which paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended as the first choice medication. However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy of paracetamol for LBP.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for non-specific LBP.

Search Methods

We conducted searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which includes the Back and Neck Review Group trials register), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, LILACS, and IPA from their inception to 7 August 2015. We also searched the reference lists of eligible papers and trial registry websites (WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov).

Selection Criteria

We only considered randomised trials comparing the efficacy of paracetamol with placebo for non-specific LBP. The primary outcomes were pain and disability. We also investigated quality of life, function, adverse effects, global impression of recovery, sleep quality, patient adherence, and use of rescue medication as secondary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed the data extraction and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. We also evaluated the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We converted scales for pain intensity to a common 0 to 100 scale. We quantified treatment effects using mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We used effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of treatment effect for the primary outcomes. When the treatment effects were smaller than 9 points on a 0 to 100 scale, we considered the effect as small and not clinically important.

Main Results

Our searches retrieved 4449 records, of which three trials were included in the review (n = 1825 participants), and two trials were included in the meta-analysis. For acute LBP, there is high-quality evidence for no difference between paracetamol (4 g per day) and placebo at 1 week (immediate term), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks (short term) for the primary outcomes. There is high-quality evidence that paracetamol has no effect on quality of life, function, global impression of recovery, and sleep quality for all included time periods. There were also no significant differences between paracetamol and placebo for adverse events, patient adherence, or use of rescue medication. For chronic LBP, there is very low-quality evidence (based on a trial that has been retracted) for no effect of paracetamol (1 g single intravenous dose) on immediate pain reduction. Finally, no trials were identified evaluating patients with subacute LBP.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that paracetamol does not produce better outcomes than placebo for people with acute LBP, and it is uncertain if it has any effect on chronic LBP.

Limitations

Despite its benefits, physical therapy has several limitations. The variation in methods among practitioners leads to inconsistent clinical outcomes. Access to physical therapy remains a challenge in rural areas or developing countries. Although generally efficient, the initial costs can still pose a barrier, particularly for patients without health insurance. Furthermore, not all patients respond optimally to therapy, as psychosocial factors, commitments, comorbidities, or fear-avoidance behaviors can influence therapeutic success. The lack of individualized approaches and the excessive use of passive modalities also contribute to the low effectiveness.

Pharmacological Therapy

Drug Types and the WHO Pain Ladder

Pharmacological management — most commonly with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — remains a standard option for LBP. The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates a stepwise approach to pain management, progressing from acetaminophen and NSAIDs to muscle relaxants, tramadol, corticosteroids, and, in select cases, short-term opioids for moderate-to-severe pain.

In primary care, NSAIDs combined with muscle relaxants are frequently prescribed, typically administered on a scheduled basis rather than "as needed" to optimize pain relief. Patients often experience symptom improvement within one week, although the effect is less pronounced compared with either medication used alone. Opioids are reserved for short-term relief in severe cases but carry substantial risks. NSAID therapy, however, is sometimes discontinued due to adverse effects.

Benefits and Risks NSAID Use

Despite being inexpensive and widely available, NSAIDs are associated with significant safety concerns, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, impaired renal function, and cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs), particularly with prolonged use. While NSAID administration has been shown to reduce pain and functional impairment in patients with persistent low back pain, NSAIDs alone have not demonstrated superior efficacy in managing acute LBP compared to physical therapy or spinal manipulation. In rehabilitation settings, targeted physical therapy interventions have consistently produced more favorable outcomes — reducing pain intensity and improving functional activity — than standard NSAID treatment.

### Tolperisone for the treatment of acute muscle spasm of the back: results from the dose-ranging phase 2 STAR study (NCT03802565) [^115p8v6L]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

When first-line options to treat acute muscle spasm have failed to deliver the desired results, patients are typically treated with an SMR (eg, cyclobenzaprine). Although SMRs can provide pain relief, tolerability issues, in particularly somnolence, represent a significant issue. In a meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials focused on back pain in association with muscle spasm, 20% of patients treated with cyclobenzaprine reported drowsiness. In two randomized placebo-controlled studies of low-dose regimens of cyclobenzaprine in acute skeletal muscle spasm, somnolence occurred in 29% and 38% of subjects receiving 5 mg TID and 10 mg TID, respectively. In a pharmacokinetic study, 100% of healthy volunteers receiving a once-daily extended-release formulation of cyclobenzaprine reported somnolence. In a randomized trial of acute back pain, adding cyclobenzaprine to an existing naproxen regimen did not improve functional assessments or measures of pain but did increase AEs. Given the widespread use of SMRs for the treatment of back pain, an effective therapeutic option must provide the pain relief that patients require without the untoward off-target CNS effects.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — Recommendation 2a suggests that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that oral NSAIDs reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days after treatment and were associated with a greater likelihood of symptom relief, and there was also moderate-certainty evidence that acetaminophen reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days; oral NSAIDs were associated with an increased risk for GI adverse events and oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen did not differ statistically. Clinicians should assess patients' risk factors (for GI and renal) and treatment preferences in choosing between NSAIDs and acetaminophen.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^111XafBa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a common symptom in people of all ages and socioeconomic status. The worldwide point prevalence of low back pain (acute, subacute and chronic) was 7.83% (95% CI 7.04 to 8.64) in 2017, with 577 million people affected at any one time. In 2017, low back pain was responsible for around 65 million years lived with disability, representing a deterioration of about 17.5% since 2007 mainly owing to population growth and ageing, with the greatest increase recorded for low-income and middle-income countries. People more often leave their job because of low back pain than diabetes, hypertension, neoplasm, asthma, heart and respiratory disease combined. About one in four adults in the United States had low back pain that lasted for at least 24 hours within the previous 3 months, with 7.6% adults reporting at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a 1-year period. Moderate-to-severe pain and impairment of motor and psychological functions due to low back pain are the primary reasons for seeking medical consultation from a general practitioner.

Despite its high prevalence, low back pain has a generally good prognosis. While a specific cause of low back pain can seldom be identified, the most prevalent type is mechanical, non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP). Most episodes of acute and subacute NS-LBP improve significantly within 6 weeks, and the average pain intensity is moderate (6 on a 100-point scale; 95% CI 3 to 10) by 12 months. However, two-thirds of people with low back pain still experience pain at 3 months (67%, 95% CI 50% to 83%) and at 12 months (65%, 95% CI 54% to 75%).

Most guidelines agree on the first line of care in case of acute episode: advice, reassurance and encouragement to engage in light physical activity. When second-line treatment is needed, a range of therapeutic interventions (pharmacological and physiotherapy) for acute NS-LBP are available. The relative effects of various treatment options, when each option is compared against all others, are not well known. This uncertainty is reflected in the variety of recommendations in recent guidelines for acute NS-LBP. We explored the relative efficacy of currently available treatments for acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP in terms of benefit and harm via a systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis (NMA).

### Harms and benefits of opioids for management of non-surgical acute and chronic low back pain: a systematic review [^111yt792]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Consequences of prescription opioid use involve harms, addiction, tolerance and death. Despite routine prescription, opioids are not recommended for initial intervention by any major multidisciplinary low back pain (LBP) guideline.

Objective

Our primary purpose was to improve overall understanding of the harms and benefits associated with oral opioid interventions prescribed for treatment of acute or chronic back pain. Our second goal was to evaluate pain intensity and to compare and contrast these data with the harms. Our last objective was to evaluate conflicts of interest among the study authors and the findings.

Design/Data/Eligibility Criteria

Studies incorporating oral prescription opioid management of non-surgical LBP were evaluated. After systematic assessment, no studies that met inclusion included participants with specifically acute LBP. Therefore, extracted data reflects only populations with subacute and chronic LBP. Data on reported harms, severe harms, pain outcomes and withdrawal rates were extracted and meta-analyses were completed for opioid versus placebo trials and opioids versus non-opioid trials.

Results

Fourteen studies met inclusion/exclusion requirements. All trials involved short-term management with limited follow-up. A high percentage of harms were identified across most studies. Opioids were not shown to be superior to other medications, and only showed superiority to placebo comparators (at cost of additional harms).

Conclusion

This review identified trends of higher harms rates and higher percentages of severe harms in opioid arms for the management of subacute and chronic LBP. The majority of trials that demonstrated benefits with opioids also had potential conflicts of interest. Lastly, non-opioid medications demonstrated statistically significant pain improvement compared with opioids. We feel that the results of the trial are supportive of current LBP guidelines and do not condone the initial use of opioids in management of subacute or chronic LBP.

### Efficacy of a low-dose regimen of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in acute skeletal muscle spasm: results of two placebo-controlled trials [^116f2Vpy]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is a muscle relaxant that is effective in improving muscle spasm, reducing local pain and tenderness, and increasing range of motion in acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Sedation is the most common adverse event associated with its use at the usual dosage of 10 mg TID. Studies in healthy adults suggest that a lower dose may produce less sedation. Because cyclobenzaprine's duration of action is 4 to 6 hours, reducing the dosing frequency to 10 mg BID would create a potentially painful untreated interval between doses. The alternative is administration of a lower dose (eg, 5 or 2.5 mg) TID.

Objective

These studies were designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of cyclobenzaprine 2.5, 5, and 10 mg TID compared with placebo in patients with acute musculoskeletal spasm.

Methods

In 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials conducted at primary care centers in the United States, adult patients with acute painful muscle spasm of the lumbar or cervical region were randomly assigned to receive treatment with 2.5, 5, or 10 mg cyclobenzaprine TID or placebo for 7 days (study 1: cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg TID or placebo; study 2: cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg TID or placebo). The primary efficacy measures were patient-rated clinical global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache. Neither study included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as an active control. Although physicians frequently prescribe an analgesic or NSAID in addition to cyclobenzaprine, these studies were not designed to assess whether adding cyclobenzaprine provides a benefit over that of an analgesic.

Results

One thousand four hundred five patients (737 study 1; 668 study 2), two thirds with low back pain and one third with neck pain, were randomized to treatment. Their mean age was 42 years, and approximately 89% were white. In both studies, patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg had significantly higher mean scores on the primary efficacy measures compared with those receiving placebo (study 1-P ≤ 0.001 cyclobenzaprine 5 and 10 mg vs placebo, all measures at visits 2 and 3; study 2-P ≤ 0.03 cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg vs placebo, relief from starting backache on day 3 only; cyclobenzaprine 5 mg vs placebo, patient-rated clinical global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache at visit 3 or day 7 only). On day 7, significantly more patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg reported relief compared with placebo recipients (P < 0.05 all cyclobenzaprine groups vs placebo). Onset of relief was apparent within 3 or 4 doses of the 5-mg regimen. In the subanalysis of the proportion of responders in the pooled 5-mg groups who did and did not report somnolence, a meaningful treatment effect was observed on all primary efficacy variables in patients who did not report somnolence, suggesting that efficacy was independent of sedation. Cyclobenzaprine was well tolerated. Somnolence and dry mouth, the most common adverse effects, were mild and dose related. Overall, ≥ 1 adverse event was reported in 54.1%, 61.8%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 1 and by 43.9%, 55.9%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 2. Adverse events were the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment in the cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg groups in both studies. In study 2, ineffectiveness of therapy was the main reason for discontinuation of therapy in the group receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg.

Conclusions

Cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg TID was not significantly more effective than placebo. The cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg TID regimens were associated with significantly higher mean efficacy scores compared with placebo. Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg TID was as effective as 10 mg TID, and was associated with a lower incidence of sedation.

### Clinical efficacy of tuina therapy for acute lumbar sprain: a Bayesian network meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials [^115K7PMW]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute lumbar sprain (ALS), a prevalent clinical condition that frequently affects young and middle-aged individuals, particularly those engaged in heavy manual labor, involves the acute tearing of soft tissues, including muscles, fascia, and ligaments, caused by sudden excessive external forces that commonly occur during the forceful contraction of the lumbar muscles during exercise or heavy lifting. The primary clinical manifestations of this condition include severe back pain, localized pain, and limited spinal mobility. ALS is a prevalent clinical condition that frequently affects young and middle-aged individuals, particularly those engaged in heavy manual labor. The incidence rate is higher in males than in females. According to survey results, approximately 60–80% of young individuals and manual laborers experience ALS. This common health issue significantly affects quality of life and work capacity. Failure to promptly and effectively treat the disease in its acute phase can lead to chronicity, imposing a greater burden on patients.

Currently, Western medicine advocates the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications, pain-point blockades, and muscle relaxants for the symptomatic treatment of ALS. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are considered the primary pharmacological agents in Western medicine for the management of ALS.NSAIDs effectively alleviate pain by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity and suppressing prostaglandin synthesis. Muscle relaxants are also commonly employed in ALS treatment to relieve symptoms by impeding nerve impulse conduction in skeletal muscles and inducing muscle relaxation. Oral and local injectable therapies have distinct adverse effects.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages in the treatment of this disease. Tuina can effectively modulate the tension of muscles, fascia, and other soft tissues. This modulation helps alleviate the mechanical compression resulting from sprains, improves pain management and blood circulation, and facilitates the recovery of lumbar function. Tuina therapy for ALS offers several benefits, including remarkable clinical efficacy, minimal side effects, affordability, and high safety standards. However, employing Tuina alone may yield slightly suboptimal outcomes; hence, combining Tuina with intervention methods such as acupuncture or Western medicine could potentially enhance therapeutic efficacy.

For chronic low back pain, there is conflicting evidence that SMT outcomes are clinically different than no treatment, medication or modalities (Grade of Recommendation: I). Scope note: This review examined only evidence in the sub-set of patients without radiating pain, and therefore a definitive statement of SMT in all patients with LBP cannot be made.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114mEvKq]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Pain intensity

Pain intensity was measured in all 98 trials. Three trials measured pain intensity only during movement. Pain intensity was measured with a 100 mm visual analogue scale (23 trials), a 10 cm visual analogue scale (16 trials), a 11 point numerical rating scale (seven trials), or another ordinal scale (24 trials). Data for pain intensity were analysed in 66 (67%) of 98 trials. Ten trials were at low risk of bias, 36 trials had some concerns, and 20 trials were at high risk of bias (supplement 2m). Endpoint data were reported in 50 trials and changes from baseline were reported in 16 trials. Fifteen trials (23%) required standard deviation imputation. Pain intensity data were transformed in 16 trials: 12 used count data, two used 95% confidence interval for group mean, one used median, one used range. The 66 trials did not form a connected network (fig 2, fig 3). The placebo network compared 39 interventions (38 medicines and the central node of placebo) in 54 trials (fig 2). Most comparisons consisted of a single trial, ranging from one to three, and had a limited number of closed loops. Direct evidence was available for 52 (7%) of 741 comparisons. The naproxen network compared 13 medicines in 10 trials (the central node was naproxen) with one trial per comparison (fig 3). Direct evidence was available for 14 (18%) of 78 comparisons. Two trialswere not included in either network because these trials do not connect to any part of the network).

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ikMoi]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International clinical practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for the use of muscle relaxants; of 15 clinical practice guidelines, six recommend muscle relaxants to manage low back pain, five do not recommend them, and four do not offer a recommendation. Our review shows uncertainty of evidence for the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Although non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might reduce pain intensity at two weeks or less for acute low back pain, the effect is unlikely to be considered clinically important. In addition, non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics could increase the risk of an adverse event being reported (commonly, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and nausea), but might have little to no effect on treatment discontinuation, suggesting the treatment and increased risk of adverse events are acceptable. The low to very low certainty of evidence does not, however, allow any firm recommendations. We would encourage clinicians to discuss this uncertainty in the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants with patients, sharing information about the possibility for a worthwhile benefit in pain reduction but increased risk of experiencing a non-serious adverse event, to allow them to make informed treatment decisions.

Unanswered questions and future research

Large, definitive, placebo controlled trials are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. New trials should follow the core outcome set for non-specific low back painand the recommendations of the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials, to improve the pooling of results and comparability between trials. Future trials should also endeavour to adhere to methodological safeguards to reduce bias and transparently report results following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement.

Although muscle relaxants are typically prescribed for short term use, the effects of long term use are not known. High quality data are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long term use. This is particularly important when considering that the risk of dependency and misuse associated with muscle relaxants has been observed from indirect evidence.

Conclusions

This systematic review found very low certainty evidence that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics for the treatment of acute low back pain might provide a small and not clinically meaningful improvement in pain intensity at two weeks or less. The risk of adverse events but not serious adverse events might be increased with use of non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics, although the evidence ranges from low to very low certainty. Large, high quality, placebo controlled trials are urgently needed to resolve uncertainties about the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants for low back pain.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^1112ppNB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting. The guidance is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. This guideline does not address noninvasive treatment of low back pain, which is covered by a separate ACP guideline that has also been endorsed by AAFP.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review on the comparative efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting and a systematic review on the predictors of prolonged opioid use. We evaluated the following clinical outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system: pain (at ≤ 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days), physical function, symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain; improve physical function; and improve the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2a

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2b

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP suggest against clinicians treating patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Prior systematic reviews, on the effectiveness or efficacy of longer-term use of SMRs were conducted before this growth of use, focused on specific conditions such as low back pain, and were limited to clinical trials. Given the increase in use of this medication class, and because approximately one-third of patients being prescribed SMRs do not have a preceding musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis, a broader examination of their long-term use for multiple chronic conditions is needed. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness or efficacy of long-term (≥ 4 weeks) use of SMRs for chronic (≥ 3 months) pain.

Evidentiary table — NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors administered to treat low back pain: A Cochrane review reported 65 trials qualified for review; review authors found NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs (acetaminophen, opioids, and muscle relaxants), placebo and acetaminophen had fewer adverse effects than NSAIDs although NSAIDs had fewer adverse effects than muscle relaxants and opioids, and the new COX-2 NSAIDs do not seem to be more effective than traditional NSAIDs but are associated with fewer adverse effects, particularly stomach ulcers, with other literature showing that some COX-2 NSAIDs are associated with increased cardiovascular risk; for acute low back pain, 7 studies, 5 of which including 1 higher-quality study, did not find any statistical differences between NSAIDs and opioids or muscle relaxants, and there is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^111dH9Pd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute and subacute non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) based on pain and disability outcomes.

Design

A systematic review of the literature with network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception until 17 October 2020.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) involving adults with NS-LBP who experienced pain for less than 6 weeks (acute) or between 6 and 12 weeks (subacute).

Results

Forty-six RCTs (n = 8765) were included; risk of bias was low in 9 trials (19.6%), unclear in 20 (43.5%), and high in 17 (36.9%). At immediate-term follow-up, for pain decrease, the most efficacious treatments against an inert therapy were: exercise (standardised mean difference (SMD) −1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.41 to –0.40), heat wrap (SMD −1.38; 95% CI −2.60 to –0.17), opioids (SMD −0.86; 95% CI −1.62 to –0.10), manual therapy (SMD −0.72; 95% CI −1.40 to –0.04) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (SMD −0.53; 95% CI −0.97 to –0.09). Similar findings were confirmed for disability reduction in non-pharmacological and pharmacological networks, including muscle relaxants (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.04). Mild or moderate adverse events were reported in the opioids (65.7%), NSAIDs (54.3%) and steroids (46.9%) trial arms.

Conclusion

With uncertainty of evidence, NS-LBP should be managed with non-pharmacological treatments which seem to mitigate pain and disability at immediate-term. Among pharmacological interventions, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants appear to offer the best harm–benefit balance.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^112E25gN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest NMA to date in the field of low back pain (46 RCTs involving 8765 participants assigned to pharmacological, non-pharmacological or inert treatment). We found that pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were more efficacious than inert treatment for reducing pain intensity and disability due to acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP. Overall, the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, with high certainty of evidence for manual therapy compared with usual care and education.

For reducing pain intensity, the most efficacious interventions at immediate-term follow-up (close to 1 week) were heat wrap, manual therapy, exercise, NSAIDS and opioids, whereas at short-term follow-up (closest to 1 month), the most efficacious treatment was manual therapy. For reducing disability, similar findings are found in the subgroup analysis showing that heat wrap, manual therapy, exercise and education for non-pharmacological group and muscle relaxants and NSAIDs for pharmacological group are effective at immediate-term follow-up. Manual therapy confirmed the effects also for decreasing disability at short-term follow-up (closest to 1 month). Limited evidence was found for steroids when compared with NSAIDs (one study) to reduce disability.

The present analysis highlights a potentially minor role for medicines in the management of NS-LBP: initial treatment should be non-pharmacological as confirmed by the SUCRA. However, only a minority of pharmacological interventions are included in the networks. In particular, steroids and opioids are under-represented (only three studies) and their desirable effects should be weighed against side effects. In fact, mild or moderate adverse events were most often recorded for the opioids, the NSAIDs and the steroids arms. This observation is shared by recent systematic reviews that found that at least 50% of people with NS-LBP taking opioids withdrew from the study owing to adverse events or lack of efficacy, with trends noted for higher harm rates and higher percentages of severe harm.

Given that paracetamol offer limited or no benefit, its clinical value might be questionable. This finding is not reflected in all current guidelines, however. A recent Cochrane systematic reviewfound that paracetamol does not result in better outcomes compared to placebo in people with acute low back pain reporting evidence from a large multicentre RCT included in our NMA (1652 randomised people with NS-LBP) that showed no benefit of any dose of paracetamol (until 4000 mg) compared with placebo in people with moderate intensity acute low back pain.

### Analgesic effects of treatments for non-specific low back pain: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials [^114rTh1D]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Estimates of treatment effects reported in placebo-controlled randomized trials are less subject to bias than those estimates provided by other study designs. The objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate the analgesic effects of treatments for non-specific low back pain reported in placebo-controlled randomized trials.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for eligible trials from earliest records to November 2006. Continuous pain outcomes were converted to a common 0–100 scale and pooled using a random effects model.

Results

A total of 76 trials reporting on 34 treatments were included. Fifty percent of the investigated treatments had statistically significant effects, but for most the effects were small or moderate: 47% had point estimates of effects of < 10 points on the 100-point scale, 38% had point estimates from 10 to 20 points and 15% had point estimates of > 20 points. Treatments reported to have large effects (> 20 points) had been investigated only in a single trial.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis revealed that the analgesic effects of many treatments for non-specific low back pain are small and that they do not differ in populations with acute or chronic symptoms.

How is low back pain managed?

Most international guidelines advise non-drug treatment and limited, careful use of some analgesic treatments, including those endorsed by the World Health Organisation, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the American College of Physicians. People with non-specific low back pain should be advised to keep active (continue usual physical activities as much as possible), avoid bed rest (as it does not aid recovery), and use self management strategies such as heat packs. About one in five people with chronic low back pain will experience major life or work limitations and may benefit from further treatment. For people with chronic non-specific low back pain, optimal approaches use physical and psychological therapies that improve function and address psychosocial contributors to low back pain (see infographic and table 1).

Summary of current guideline recommendations for non-specific low back pain

Certainty of evidence as measured by GRADE approach (box 1)

Acute treatment as recommended by 2017 American College of Physicians guideline

Chronic treatment as recommended by 2023 WHO guidelines

NICE guidancebroadly agrees with the above except it recommends against acupuncture and makes recommendations on invasive/surgical procedures (consider radiofrequency denervation or spinal decompression for chronic low back pain in limited circumstances).

Both prescription and over-the-counter analgesics are easily accessible and widely used as an alternative or addition to non-drug treatments. Across primary care services in high income countries Australia, Portugal, US, and Switzerland,66–89% of consultations for low back pain result in a prescription for analgesia. There are limited prescribing data from low and middle income countries. Herbal medicines (such as topical cayenne pepper) and homoeopathy are prescribed for low back pain in some settings, but the type of agents used varies between regions and is influenced by cultural practices.

### Drug disposal: dispose "Non-flush list" medicine in trash… [^115ezzMC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you cannot readily get to a drug take-back location, or if a pre-paid drug mail-back envelope is not available to you, and there are no specific disposal instructions in the medication guide or package insert, you can follow these simple steps to dispose of most medicines in your trash at home:

- Remove the drugs from their original containers.
- Mix medicines with an unappealing substance such as dirt, cat litter, or used coffee grounds;
- Place the mixture in a container such as a sealed plastic bag;
- Throw away the container in your trash at home; and.
- Scratch out all personal information on the prescription label of empty medicine bottles or medicine packaging, then trash or recycle the empty bottle or packaging.
