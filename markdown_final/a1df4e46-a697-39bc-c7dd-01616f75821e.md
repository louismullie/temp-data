## Question

Can portal hypertension lead to dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether portal hypertension can lead to dementia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the mechanistic plausibility linking portal hypertension to cognitive injury. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence for hepatic encephalopathy and its chronic cognitive sequelae. Next, I will examine data on covert or minimal HE and its persistence. After that, I should review non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and TIPS-related data to isolate the contribution of portosystemic shunting. Finally, I will consider confounding, reversibility, and guideline implications before synthesizing a cautious conclusion with practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities so I don't conflate terms. Portal hypertension is a hemodynamic consequence of increased intrahepatic resistance and hyperdynamic splanchnic flow, leading to portosystemic collaterals and shunting; hepatic encephalopathy is brain dysfunction from liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting, with a spectrum from minimal HE to overt HE with coma; dementia is a chronic, usually progressive syndrome of multiple cognitive domains with functional impairment, and in cirrhosis cohorts it is frequently codiagnosed with HE, which complicates attribution and reversibility assessment [^e1fdda68].

> Now, I need to check mechanistic plausibility. Portal hypertension drives portosystemic shunting that bypasses hepatocyte clearance of gut-derived neurotoxins, especially ammonia, and promotes systemic inflammation and cerebral edema; this constellation produces neuropsychiatric impairment in HE, and chronic or repeated episodes plausibly cause persistent neural injury even between overt events, which could manifest as a dementia phenotype in susceptible patients [^4a28ae53] [^c34a7a2b] [^72780457].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. Wait, let me verify prevalence and risk gradients. Overt HE is common in cirrhosis and tightly linked to disease severity and portosystemic shunting; prevalence at cirrhosis diagnosis is about 10–14% and rises to 16–21% in decompensated disease, with 10–50% after TIPS, underscoring the causal role of shunting; importantly, even minimal HE is present in 20–80% of patients with cirrhosis, indicating widespread subclinical brain dysfunction even without overt episodes [^72780457]. Hold on, I should also confirm that minimal HE predicts overt HE and adverse outcomes; yes, minimal HE correlates with future overt episodes and is associated with falls and impaired daily function, supporting clinical relevance beyond subtle testing abnormalities [^72780457] [^d2598cf5].

> I will now examine whether this cognitive injury persists beyond apparent resolution of HE. Let me consider longitudinal and neurophysiological data. After TIPS, neurophysiological measures show further subclinical deterioration at 6 months even without clinically overt HE, suggesting ongoing brain dysfunction with sustained portosystemic shunting; clinically, persistent cognitive deficits are reported after apparent HE resolution, and large cohort data in veterans show that HE — but not other decompensation events like ascites — independently associates with a dementia diagnosis, implying a specific brain-injury signal rather than generic illness severity [^5520fd99] [^72780457] [^e1fdda68]. But wait, what if this is just misclassification? The authors acknowledge the diagnostic challenge and still find a robust association after adjustment, which strengthens inference even if causality cannot be proven from observational designs alone [^e1fdda68].

> Next, I should review non-cirrhotic portal hypertension to isolate the effect of shunting from parenchymal liver failure. In non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, covert HE is present in roughly one-third of patients and correlates with large spontaneous portosystemic shunts; this supports the concept that shunting per se can produce measurable cognitive impairment even when hepatocellular function is relatively preserved, reinforcing a direct path from portal hypertension to brain dysfunction via bypass of hepatic detoxification [^0a95ab30].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reversibility. I need to ensure I distinguish potentially reversible HE-related cognitive impairment from irreversible neurodegeneration. Many HE deficits improve with therapy and correction of precipitants, yet a subset persists despite biochemical clearing of ammonia, and repeated or severe episodes may cause cumulative injury; case-level evidence shows that closing a surgical portosystemic shunt can reverse hyperammonemia and improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, but broader dementia outcomes are less certain and likely depend on timing and baseline brain vulnerability [^7574f44c] [^72780457]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought most HE-related cognitive changes were fully reversible; I should correct that — contemporary data indicate that some deficits persist and that minimal HE is associated with ongoing functional impairment and future overt events, so not all cognitive injury is transient [^72780457] [^d2598cf5].

> I should double-check confounding and competing etiologies. Cirrhosis cohorts often include older adults with diabetes, alcohol use, and cerebrovascular disease, all of which increase dementia risk; however, the association of HE with dementia persisted after multivariable adjustment in the veteran cohort, and emerging data suggest clinicians should actively screen for undiagnosed cirrhosis in patients with dementia because HE may be a reversible contributor to cognitive decline in a meaningful subset [^e1fdda68] [^15ed2080]. Let me reconsider the directionality: while some cognitive complaints may reflect minimal HE rather than primary neurodegeneration, the convergence of repeated HE episodes, persistent deficits, and shunting biology makes a causal contribution biologically plausible and clinically actionable in selected patients [^72780457].

> Next, I should review guideline signals to gauge clinical consensus. Contemporary hepatology guidance emphasizes screening for covert or minimal HE in advanced liver disease and around TIPS, reflecting recognition that HE is common, prognostically important, and often underrecognized; this aligns with the notion that portal hypertension–related brain injury is a clinically significant entity that warrants systematic detection and management rather than dismissal as "just confusion" [^7f79efb8] [^fc57faf1] [^796f1efc].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Portal hypertension can lead to dementia via repeated or sustained portosystemic shunting that causes neurotoxin accumulation, neuroinflammation, and cerebral edema, producing HE with a spectrum of severity; a subset of patients develop persistent cognitive deficits that meet criteria for dementia, particularly with recurrent or severe HE, advanced liver disease, or large shunts, and this risk is mechanistically coherent and supported by epidemiologic and interventional data even if not proven by randomized trials [^4a28ae53] [^72780457] [^e1fdda68] [^0a95ab30]. Clinically, I need to ensure we screen for HE in patients with cirrhosis and cognitive complaints, treat and prevent recurrences with lactulose and rifaximin, and consider shunt modification or closure in select refractory cases, while also evaluating for other dementia etiologies because comorbidity is common and not all cognitive decline in cirrhosis is purely HE-related [^d6decdd3] [^7574f44c] [^15ed2080].

---

Portal hypertension can cause **cognitive impairment** through portosystemic shunting and neurotoxin accumulation, producing hepatic encephalopathy (HE) [^c34a7a2b] with deficits in attention, memory, and executive function [^72780457]. While HE is often reversible with treatment, **repeated or chronic HE** can lead to persistent cognitive decline that mimics dementia, especially in older adults or those with repeated episodes [^72780457] [^e1fdda68]. Large cohort data show HE is independently associated with dementia in cirrhosis, and TIPS increases HE risk, underscoring the causal link [^e1fdda68] [^54f0e074]. Thus, portal hypertension can cause a **dementia-like syndrome** via HE, particularly with recurrent or severe disease [^e1fdda68].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking portal hypertension to cognitive impairment

Portal hypertension drives **portosystemic shunting**, bypassing hepatic detoxification and allowing neurotoxins — especially ammonia — to reach the brain, causing astrocytic swelling, neuroinflammation, and neuronal dysfunction [^c34a7a2b] [^3688f456]. Additional contributors include **manganese deposition**, cerebral edema, and systemic inflammation, which together produce the neuropsychiatric syndrome of HE [^c34a7a2b] [^3688f456].

---

## Clinical evidence of cognitive impairment in portal hypertension

- **Prevalence of hepatic encephalopathy**: HE is common in cirrhosis, with overt HE in 10–14% at diagnosis and 16–21% in decompensated disease; minimal HE (covert HE) occurs in 20–80% and is often undetected without testing [^72780457].

- **Cognitive domains affected**: HE impairs attention, working memory, processing speed, and executive function, with deficits correlating to ammonia levels and shunt severity [^c34a7a2b] [^54f0e074].

- **Persistent cognitive impairment**: Repeated or chronic HE can cause lasting deficits that persist after biochemical resolution, particularly in older adults or those with repeated episodes [^72780457] [^e1fdda68].

---

## Evidence linking portal hypertension to dementia

Large cohort data show that among cirrhosis complications, **hepatic encephalopathy is independently associated with dementia**, indicating a specific brain-injury signal beyond generic illness severity [^e1fdda68]. TIPS increases HE risk by 30–55% and can precipitate or worsen cognitive decline, reinforcing the causal role of portosystemic shunting [^54f0e074] [^d2598cf5]. Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension also causes covert HE in 25–34% when large shunts are present, supporting shunt-mediated neurotoxin exposure as a key driver [^0a95ab30].

| Diagnostic tools | - Ammonia levels <br/> - Psychometric testing <br/> - EEG | - Neuropsychological testing <br/> - MRI <br/> - PET |
| Treatment response | Rapid improvement with lactulose/rifaximin | Limited response |

## Reversibility of cognitive impairment

HE-related cognitive impairment is often **reversible with therapy** (lactulose, rifaximin, dietary protein management), and TIPS-related HE may improve with shunt modification or occlusion in select cases [^eb682ae2] [^7574f44c]. However, repeated or severe HE can cause persistent deficits, especially in older adults or those with repeated episodes, so early recognition and prevention are critical [^72780457] [^e1fdda68].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Screening and diagnosis**: Routine screening for minimal HE with psychometric testing is recommended in cirrhosis, especially before TIPS or in patients with cognitive complaints [^7f79efb8] [^fc57faf1].

- **Treatment**: Lactulose and rifaximin are first-line to reduce ammonia and prevent recurrence; TIPS patients benefit from proactive HE prophylaxis and close follow-up [^eb682ae2] [^f2d2fd6b].

- **Patient education**: Patients and caregivers should be educated to recognize early HE symptoms and adhere to therapy to limit cumulative brain injury [^a21a0e93].

---

Portal hypertension can cause a **dementia-like syndrome** through repeated or chronic hepatic encephalopathy, with persistent cognitive deficits in vulnerable patients. Early detection, aggressive HE management, and risk modification can mitigate this burden.

### Infection and liver cirrhosis: possible association with hepatic encephalopathy and / or post-hepatic encephalopathy cognitive impairment in patients with portal hypertension [^29183f00]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In their retrospective series, Sathar et al concluded that there is significant association between Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp -I) and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) in cirrhotic patients, also related to PHG severity, thereby necessitating Hp eradication.

Apart from PHG, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is another complication of portal hypertension that remains a major cause of morbidity in cirrhotic patients. HE encompasses a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders related to liver failure and the mechanisms responsible for the neurological alterations in HE begin to emerge.

Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infections are among the commonest causes of liver cirrhosis worldwide; Hp -I is strongly associated with HBV- and HCV-related cirrhosis in Europe; Hp -I is more common in cirrhotic patients with HE than in those without; HE is not a fully reversible condition and the mechanism behind the lack of reversibility of the neurocognitive status despite the resolution of mental status changes is unclear; and cognitive dysfunction is a factor associated with falls in cirrhotic patients, though further studies are warranted to address the mechanisms implicated in this predisposition and to design preventive strategies. In this regard, Hp -I has been frequently detected in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and we found that Hp eradication may positively influence AD manifestations at five-year clinical endpoints, thereby supporting a role for this common infection in the pathobiology of the disease.

Hp may be involved in the pathophysiology of both HE and post-HE persistent cognitive impairment by several mechanisms, including the release of proinflammatory/vasoactive substances, involved, through blood-brain-barrier disruption, in a number of vascular disorders including AD, which can lead to long-term neurologic deficits. It is therefore important to know if the authors have considered the association between Hp -I, HE and/or post-HE cognitive impairment in their cirrhotic patients.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a poorly defined, complex neuropsychological disorder that often accompanies portal hypertension. Although the mechanisms underlining HE and the characterization of HE are still under investigation, the information derived from functional neuroimaging of patients with HE complemented by laboratory investigation and neuropsychological and neurophysiological studies have clarified much of the neuroanatomical defects. In this review, we have provided an outline of the understood mechanisms of HE and the associated findings on neuroimaging.

Recommendation 27

We recommend that patients with suspected portal hypertension should be screened for gastro-oesophageal varices according to BSG guidelines. (Strong; Moderate)

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

HE can be the cause of significant life quality impairment in patients with advanced disease but is relatively unusual in PBC (and should not be mistaken for the much commoner cognitive impairment associated with fatigue). Where present, HE in PBC characteristically affects older patients. The first-line management is with lactulose (at a dose achieving 2–3 soft stools per day). Some patients may require regular enemas in addition to lactulose. In any patient with HE, it is important to rule out secondary causes such as constipation, dehydration, infection and upper GI bleeding. For patients with refractory encephalopathy, rifaximin is frequently used and is now NICE approved. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that improves HE, reduces hospital admission rates due to HE and the incidence of recurrent HE. It must be remembered that patients with HE cannot drive.

Patient Portal Use

We constructed metrics of patient portal use as previously described. We defined an active portal user as having a registered portal account and having logged in to complete at least one activity (eg, view lab results, view chart, message a clinician) during the observation period. A portal episode was defined as having logged in and completed at least 1 other portal activity. Portal messaging refers to the volume of patient- or care partner-initiated messages sent through the patient portal requesting medical advice.

Covariates

Patient demographic characteristics include age in years, sex (female/male), race (White/Black/Other), English as preferred language (yes/no), and married (yes/no). From the EMR problem list and encounter International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes present at the start of the observation period, we identify dementia, diabetes, hearing loss, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, and hypertension.

Statistical Analysis

We first examine differences in sample characteristics by billed AWV status, with statistical significance assessed based on chi squared, Kruskal–Wallis test, or t -test as appropriate. We then restrict our sample to older adults with an AWV and at least 1 completed health risk assessment category to comparatively evaluate the frequency of risk assessment category completion and affirmative responses by portal user status as well as absolute between-group differences by portal use. Lastly, we evaluate the volume of patient-initiated portal messages by type and number of affirmatively responded health risk assessment categories.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of ascites (correction of hyponatremia), AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L) at the time of liver transplantation increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome with liver transplantation. Consider ensuring multidisciplinary coordinated care to mitigate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^54f0e074]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of advanced liver disease, with up to 30–40% of patients developing this neurological condition as their disease progresses. The phenotype of HE can vary widely from mild cognitive impairment to more serious symptoms such as disorientation and coma. While the etiology of HE is complex, the most prevalent theory of its pathophysiology is the inability of dysfunctional hepatocytes to process enteric neurotoxins that accumulate within the splanchnic circulation, allowing them to enter the systemic circulation, and precipitate cerebral inflammation and cerebral edema.

Due to the elevated pressure within the portal venous system and resultant hepatofugal flow in the cirrhotic liver, extrahepatic collateral blood vessels known as varices form to allow for portal blood return to the vena cavae and the systemic circulation. Porto-hepatic venous collaterals, or intrahepatic shunts, can also form, although efforts to characterize this phenomenon have been sparse –. The presence of these extrahepatic and intrahepatic shunts alters toxin circulation, decreases toxin metabolism in the liver, and contributes to hepatic encephalopathy.

In severe liver disease with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is a therapeutic intervention that can reduce pathologies caused by portal hypertension. With TIPS, a synthetic shunt connects the portal venous system to the hepatic venous system, such that some blood can bypass the cirrhotic liver and reduce portal hypertension and its sequelae. Although TIPS can significantly improve the morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis and increase transplant-free survival, TIPS placement is also a known risk factor for the development of HE and, thus, preexisting HE is a relative contraindication to TIPS placement. TIPS can increase the incidence of HE by 30–55% post-procedure, with 90% of affected patients developing it within the first three months –.

While the association between TIPS placement and HE exacerbation is well-documented, the mechanism is poorly understood. Ammonia level is usually associated with HE, but studies examining ammonia level and HE development are conflicting. The association is highly dependent on the chronicity of hyperammonemia and varies greatly in outcome and thus levels are not typically followed clinically –. Therefore, neurotoxic compounds beyond ammonia likely contribute to HE. Microbial products such as aromatic amino acids and bile acids (BAs) are candidate neurotoxins, but it is still unclear which microbial products or metabolites induce HE onset and how TIPS placement affects the concentration of these compounds within the systemic circulation.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: description, prevalence and risk factors [^0a95ab30]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis but it is less studied in patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH).

Aims

To describe the prevalence of cognitive impairment (overt and covert HE) in NCPH patients and to identify the risk factors for its development.

Methods

51 patients with NCPH, 35 with chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and 16 with idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH), were evaluated for the presence of previous or present overt HE (OHE). The psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score and the SCAN battery were used to detect the presence of covert HE (CHE). 34 compensated cirrhotic patients were used as control. In NCPH patients, abdominal scans were performed to detect the presence of shunts.

Results

None of the patients experienced OHE at evaluation while 5.7% of PVT and 12.5% of INCPH patients referred at least one documented episode of previous OHE, similarly to patients with cirrhosis (14.7%). Even if lower than in patients with cirrhosis (64.7%), a considerable proportion of patients with chronic PVT (34.3%) and INCPH (25%) had CHE (p = 0.008). The presence of a large portal-systemic shunt was the only factor significantly correlated to cognitive impairment in NCPH patients.

Conclusion

HE is a tangible complication of NCPH and is mainly related to the presence of portal-systemic shunts.

Patient selection

Figure 3 is a summary of the key aspects of patient selection.

Summary of recommendations for patient selection prior to TIPSS.

Hepatic encephalopathy

Pre-TIPSS assessment of encephalopathy

As with all portosystemic shunts, the major complication post-TIPSS is HE. This is particularly heartbreaking for the relatives/carers, who will be the first to notice changes in cognition. Phrases such as "I no longer recognise my husband/wife" reflect a poor outcome, especially when the TIPSS has been a palliative procedure in someone with recurrent ascites. The incidence of encephalopathy has been quoted as high as 55% and is dependent on patient and attainment factors: assiduous searching for encephalopathy will identify a higher incidence.

Every effort needs to be made to identify those at risk of post-TIPSS HE, especially in the elective setting. This is harder to do when the TIPSS is being considered in an emergency, and under these circumstances, a history may be all that is available, for example, a history of debilitating encephalopathy in someone with an acute variceal bleed is a contraindication to a TIPSS unless there is a major competing portosystemic shunt that can be embolised.

Patient-related factors perhaps predictably include: age, severity of liver disease, history of preceding encephalopathyand size of shunt. A Child-Pugh score equal or greater than 10 was a proposed cut-off point. The recently recognised additional risk factor of diabetes may well reflect altered renal handling of ammonia. This latter consideration is increasingly important, as many of the referrals for TIPSS for diuretic resistant ascites are in patients who have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and who are diabetic.

While these simple clinical markers are easy to obtain, most elective patients will have well-preserved liver function. The major advance has been the recognition of the clinical disorder "covert" or subclinical encephalopathy. This is a disorder in which patients with chronic liver disease exhibit specific, reversible, quantifiable, neuropsychological or electroencephalographic abnormalities in the absence of clinically obvious mental or neurologic defects. The critical next step is the identification that covert hepatic encephalopathy predicts the development of overt hepatic encephalopathty. This has driven the search for accurate techniques that identify covert encephalopathy, and parameters which predict the development of overt encephalopathy post-TIPSS.

### Portal hypertension [^137d06ed]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension is the main complication of cirrhosis and is responsible for its most common complications: variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and portosystemic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension is the result of increased intrahepatic resistance and increased portal venous inflow, which in turn is the result of splanchnic vasodilatation. Vasodilatation (splanchnic and systemic) and hyperdynamic circulation are hemodynamic abnormalities typical of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Gastroesophageal varices result almost solely from portal hypertension, although the hyperdynamic circulation contributes to variceal growth and hemorrhage. Ascites results from sinusoidal hypertension and sodium retention, which is, in turn, secondary to vasodilatation and activation of neurohumoral systems. The hepatorenal syndrome represents the result of extreme vasodilatation with an extreme decrease in effective blood volume that leads to maximal activation of vasoconstrictive systems, renal vasoconstriction, and renal failure. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a potentially lethal infection of ascites that occurs in the absence of a local source of infection. Portosystemic encephalopathy is a consequence of both portal hypertension (shunting of blood through portosystemic collaterals) and hepatic insufficiency that result in the accumulation of neurotoxins in the brain. This paper reviews the recent advances in the pathophysiology and management of the complications of portal hypertension.

### The annual wellness visit health risk assessment: potential of patient portal-based completion and patient-oriented education and support [^d0b0fbfb]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the Study Sample by Annual Wellness Visit and Portal Use

Of 12 756 older adults eligible for a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, 8420 (66.0%) incurred a billed AWV and completed questions for ≥ 1 health risk assessment category during the observation period. The 12 756 primary care patients who were eligible for the AWV had a mean age of 76.2 years, were predominantly female, White, and indicated English as the preferred language (Table 1).

Table 1.
Characteristics of Eligible Older Adults by Billed Annual Wellness Visit (AWV).

Compared with older adults who did not incur a billed AWV, those who did were more likely to be White (70.0% vs 62.0%; p < .001) or married (51.9% vs 46.5%; p < .001). Black older adults were less likely to incur a billed AWV (22.7% vs 31.5%; p < .001). Older adults who were active portal users were more likely to incur a billed AWV than those who were not, though active portal use was high in both groups (81.0% billed AWV vs 76.8% not billed; p < .001). Those with a billed AWV (compared to without) were more likely to have a documented diagnosis of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hearing loss, or dementia. No clinically meaningful difference was observed by age, or by hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis diagnosis.

### Population attributable fraction of hypertension for dementia: global, regional, and national estimates for 186 countries [^d595a7ed]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Quantifying the proportion of dementia attributable to highly prevalent modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, is important in informing effective dementia prevention strategies. We aim to quantify the population attributable fraction (PAF) of hypertension for dementia (the proportion of dementia cases that would not occur if hypertension was eliminated) at global, regional, and national levels.

Methods

In this study, we searched international and governmental websites for global, regional, and national data reporting population hypertension (according to 10-year age categories) and dementia prevalence. MEDLINE was searched for studies reporting the risk of dementia from age at hypertension diagnosis from database inception to December 31, 2022. Longitudinal observational studies with > 500 participants reporting hazard ratios by age at hypertension diagnosis for risk of future all-cause dementia were eligible for inclusion. Studies excluded had cross-sectional methodology, specific vascular dementia or 'cognitive impairment' outcomes, and no age-specific metrics of association reported. The PAF of hypertension for dementia was calculated globally and for each country and region worldwide.

Findings

Data from the Global Burden of Disease, United Nations Population Prospectus, NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, UK Biobank, and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study were obtained. 186 countries reported dementia and hypertension prevalence data. The global PAF of hypertension for dementia was 15.8% [95% Credible Interval (CI), 8.8%–22.7%]. Latin America and the Caribbean (18.0% [95% CI, 9.4%–26.6%]), and Europe (17.2% [95% CI, 9.6%–24.7%]) had the highest PAF of hypertension for dementia. Hypertension diagnosed between the ages of 30–44 had the highest age-specific global attributable fraction for dementia (8.4% [95% CI, 3.4%–13.5%]), followed by ages 45–54 (2.92% [95% CI, 0.96%–4.88%]), 55–64 (2.59% [95% CI, 1.15%–4.03%]) and 65–74 (1.82% [95% CI, −2.31%–5.96%]).

Interpretation

The population attributable risk of hypertension for dementia is 15.8%, suggesting that optimal detection and treatment, particularly at midlife, has the potential to markedly reduce the global burden of dementia.

### New assessment of hepatic encephalopathy [^fc0a8f89]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis that requires careful appraisal of the clinical manifestations, evaluation of the underlying neurological disorders, and assessment of liver function and the portal-systemic circulation. This article reviews recent developments in the assessment of HE and discusses the controversy regarding the use of a categorical or a continuous approach in measuring the severity of this condition. New scales facilitate effective monitoring and assessment of episodic HE. Neuropsychological test batteries and neurophysiological tests are of value for evaluating cognitive function in outpatients and can establish the diagnosis of minimal HE, and the severity of low-grade HE. These tools allow better evaluation of the origin of cognitive complaints and help in estimating the risk of accidents. It is now possible to complete the evaluation with measurement of the effects of cognitive impairment on daily living. In difficult cases, imaging of the brain and portal-systemic circulation with magnetic resonance imaging is especially helpful. Based on these studies, neurological signs and symptoms can be attributed to HE in patients with mild liver disease and in those with complex neurological manifestations. The new methods presented are also valuable for investigating the neurological manifestations occurring after liver transplantation.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — epidemiology and natural history in cirrhosis: The incidence and prevalence of HE are related to the severity of the underlying liver insufficiency and PSS, and in patients with cirrhosis, fully symptomatic overt HE (OHE) defines the decompensated phase of the disease. The prevalence of OHE at the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis is 10%-14% in general, 16%-21% in those with decompensated cirrhosis, and 10%-50% in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), while minimal HE (MHE) or covert HE (CHE) occurs in 20%-80% of patients with cirrhosis. The prevalence of HE in prehepatic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) is not well defined. The risk for the first bout of OHE is 5%-25% within 5 years after cirrhosis diagnosis; a previous bout confers a 40% cumulative risk of recurrence at 1 year, and recurrent OHE carries a 40% cumulative risk of another recurrence within 6 months despite lactulose; even mild cognitive dysfunction or mild electroencephalography (EEG) slowing is associated with approximately one bout of OHE per 3 years of survival. After TIPS, the median cumulative 1-year incidence of OHE is 10%-50%, and patients with HE accounted for approximately 110,000 hospitalizations.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^3688f456]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular system

The bypass of bacterial endotoxins from the splanchnic to the systemic circulation and an increased production of nitric oxide cause peripheral vasodilation and increased cardiac output in cirrhotic patients. Along with this vasodilator-mediated hyperdynamic circulatory state, decreased myocardial contractility, accentuated in cases of chronic alcohol use, has been described. These events compromise mean arterial pressure and also impair the cardiac adaptive response to resuscitative intravenous fluid expansion.

Respiratory system

Patients are at increased risk of hypoxia secondary to restrictive lung disease (due to ascites and pleural effusions), diffusion abnormalities due to pulmonary arterial and venous vasodilation and shunting, and pulmonary hypertension. Patients with large-volume ascites are also predisposed to bronchopulmonary aspiration.

Central nervous system

Hepatic encephalopathy is a reversible neurological condition associated with hepatic failure and portal hypertension that may present with varying degrees of cognitive impairment, ranging from minimal changes to deep coma. This pathophysiology is driven by cerebral edema and an increased passage of ammonia through the blood-brain barrier. Ammonia is produced via glutamine metabolism by enterocytes, and urea breakdown by gut flora. With impaired hepatocellular function and portosystemic shunting, ammonia is less likely to be converted to urea and therefore accumulates within the bloodstream. It eventually crosses the blood-brain barrier where it contributes to cerebral edema and other pathological processes.

Coagulation

Primary hemostasis is impaired in advanced cirrhosis due to thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, but it is associated with a compensatory increase in von Willebrand factor levels. Platelet abnormalities result from splenic sequestration, bone marrow suppression (secondary to alcohol, folic acid deficiency, or viral hepatitis C), decreased hepatic production of thrombopoietin, infection, and renal failure.

When activated, platelets trigger secondary hemostasis, generating thrombin to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. With the exception of von Willebrand factor, all plasma clotting factors, anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic proteins are synthesized by the liver and susceptible to advancing hepatic disease. Deficient excretion of bile salts impairs absorption of liposoluble vitamins and the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X). The liver also clears activated clotting factors, anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic proteins. Such widespread effects on coagulation and anticoagulation translate into an unpredictably increased risk of both bleeding and thrombosis.

Pre-existing comorbidities

A chart review of all patients was conducted to identify comorbidities. Any medical diseases were considered if they were listed in the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems.

Hypertension

Hypertension was defined as a diagnosis before the study started or a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg during preoperative evaluation.

Diabetes mellitus

Diabetes was either defined as a diagnosis before the study or based on plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose value or the 2-h plasma glucose value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test or the A1C criteria during preoperative evaluation.

Chronic liver disease

Chronic liver disease was defined as evidence of any of the following in the patient's chart: (a) at least two of the liver tests (ie, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) being abnormal, as defined by the laboratory where the test was performed at least 6 months apart; (b) an imaging study with radiological signs of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, or a hepatic mass, and evidence of chronic liver disease; (c) a liver biopsy consistent with chronic liver disease; or (d) a diagnostic clinical event (variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ascites).

Dementia

Dementia is a syndrome occurring as a result of a brain disease. It consists of impairment of several higher cortical functions, such as memory, comprehension, calculation, learning, judgment, and language. This disease was diagnosed before the study. It includes all kinds of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia. Cognitive testing, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, was conducted in all patients to confirm cognitive impairment.

Cerebrovascular accident

Cerebrovascular accident was defined as ischemic stroke, silent infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and silent hemorrhage. Imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, were previously reviewed to identify lesions in patients with cerebrovascular accidents.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis was defined as a diagnosis before the study started or bone density 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean for young normal people during preoperative evaluation.

Functional outcome measures

To evaluate functional outcomes, all patients were assessed immediately after transfer and 6 months post-surgery.

### Neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction in hypertension [^5edb586b]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension has emerged as a leading cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Long known to be associated with dementia caused by vascular factors, hypertension has more recently been linked also to Alzheimer disease-the major cause of dementia in older people. Thus, although midlife hypertension is a risk factor for late-life dementia, hypertension may also promote the neurodegenerative pathology underlying Alzheimer disease. The mechanistic bases of these harmful effects remain to be established. Hypertension is well known to alter in the structure and function of cerebral blood vessels, but how these cerebrovascular effects lead to cognitive impairment and promote Alzheimer disease pathology is not well understood. Furthermore, critical questions also concern whether treatment of hypertension prevents cognitive impairment, the blood pressure threshold for treatment, and the antihypertensive agents to be used. Recent advances in neurovascular biology, epidemiology, brain imaging, and biomarker development have started to provide new insights into these critical issues. In this review, we will examine the progress made to date, and, after a critical evaluation of the evidence, we will highlight questions still outstanding and seek to provide a path forward for future studies.

### Noninvasive and invasive methods for the diagnosis of portal hypertension [^56afe632]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension is a complex and multifaceted condition that arises from increased resistance to portal blood flow, often secondary to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or post hepatic etiologies. The most common cause of portal hypertension in the United States is cirrhosis, which leads to structural and dynamic changes in the liver, exacerbating portal resistance and triggering a cascade of complications. Accurate diagnosis and management are critical to mitigating these risks and improving patient outcomes. Noninvasive imaging techniques, including ultrasound, CT, MRI, and elastography, have revolutionized the diagnosis and monitoring of portal hypertension. These modalities provide qualitative and quantitative measures of liver and spleen stiffness, portal vein flow, and morphological changes, enabling early risk stratification and intervention. Invasive techniques, such as hepatic venography with pressure measurement, remain the gold standard for diagnosing portal hypertension, particularly in for cases where in which noninvasive methods are inconclusive. Direct portal pressure measurement, although more invasive than these other techniques, is occasionally necessary in specific clinical scenarios. Liver biopsy, whether percutaneous, transjugular, or transfemoral, remains a crucial tool for histopathological diagnosis and guiding treatment strategy guidance, particularly in cases of chronic liver disease. Diagnosis of portal hypertension, which involves accurate measurement of portal pressure, is essential for early risk stratification and effective management. The available noninvasive and invasive techniques for the diagnosis of portal hypertension are reviewed here.

### Pathogenesis of portal hypertensive gastropathy: translating basic research into clinical practice [^042cb76c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is often seen in patients with portal hypertension, and can lead to transfusion-dependent anemia as well as acute, life-threatening bleeding episodes. This Review focuses on the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of PHG that provide reasonable grounds for the treatment of this condition, and ultimately enable translation of basic research into clinical practice. Increased portal pressure associated with cirrhosis and liver dysfunction is critical for the development of clinically significant PHG, and leads to impaired gastric mucosal defense mechanisms that render the stomach susceptible to mucosal injury. The use of pharmacological agents such as beta-blockers reduces the frequency of bleeding episodes in PHG. As a last resort, surgical decompression of the portal system, transjugular intrahepatic stent placement and liver transplantation can resolve this condition. Elimination of known risk factors for gastric injury such as alcohol, aspirin and traditional NSAIDs is critical. The role of Helicobacter pylori colonization of the gastric mucosa in PHG is not clear. Careful and critical interpretation of human and experimental data can be helpful to establish a rationale for the medical management of this important condition.

### Portal hypertension: from bedside to bench [^e47c41a5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The initial factor leading to portal hypertension is an increase in hepatic resistance. Later, an increase in portal blood flow contributes to maintain and exacerbate portal hypertension despite the development of portosystemic collaterals. The critical step in the development and acceptance of these concepts, which proved crucial for the management of patients with portal hypertension, was the development of animal models. These allowed the full characterization of the profound hemodynamic abnormalities in the systemic and splanchnic circulation associated with portal hypertension, and the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms implicated in these disturbances. This review traces how seminal clinical observations in the 1950s raised meaningful questions that were subsequently answered at the bench, leading to our current understanding of the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and of the pathogenesis of severe complications of cirrhosis, such as variceal bleeding or ascites.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^4a28ae53]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of portal hypertension and related complications — mechanisms and sequelae are outlined as follows: Portal hypertension results from maladaptive responses to chronic liver injury and cirrhosis with structural mechanisms (fibrous tissue, regenerative nodules, microthrombi, parenchymal extinction, collapse) increasing intrahepatic vascular resistance; dynamic sinusoidal vasoconstriction contributes to 30% of the total increase in vascular tone. When the portal pressure gradient reaches values of about 10 mm Hg, portal-systemic collaterals form and compensatory splanchnic vasodilation increases portal blood flow and portal pressure. Early consequences include development of portosystemic collaterals in which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven angiogenesis plays an important role; gastroesophageal varices are the most clinically relevant collaterals because of increased risk of bleeding. Variceal bleeding is directly dependent on increased wall tension determined by portal pressure, variceal diameter, and thin wall thickness. Systemic vasodilation produces a hyperdynamic circulatory state with decreased effective arterial blood volume leading to activation of neurohumoral and vasoactive systems, sodium and water retention, and increased cardiac output, culminating in ascites and, at late stages, hepatorenal syndrome due to compensatory renal vasoconstriction. Hepatic encephalopathy is multifactorial, resulting from portosystemic shunting, impaired synthetic liver function, increased bacterial translocation, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Pulmonary vascular imbalances yield hepatopulmonary syndrome (increased vasodilation) and portopulmonary hypertension (increased vasoconstriction).

### Population attributable fraction of hypertension for dementia: global, regional, and national estimates for 186 countries [^abb82f24]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The Global Population Attributable Fraction of hypertension for dementia is 15.8% (95% CI, 8.8%–22.7%), with the highest attributable fraction in those developing hypertension at age 30–44 years (PAF 8.4% [95% CI, 3.4%–13.5%]). In 2019, we estimate that 9.5 million cases of dementia were attributable to hypertension globally. Our findings, in the context of a recent meta-analysis reporting a significant reduction in dementia risk with anti-hypertensive therapy, suggest that a large proportion of dementia cases may be prevented with optimal detection and treatment of hypertension globally. Moreover, identification and treatment of hypertension in early and mid-adult life is of particular importance in reducing the global burden of dementia. The World Health Organisation's global action plan for dementia recommends treatment of midlife hypertension to reduce the risk of dementia; the potential impact of these recommendations is highlighted by this study.

The only international study to report the PAF of hypertension for dementia is the 10/66 Dementia Research study, which included participants from India, China and six Latin America countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. In that study, the estimated PAF for hypertension was 3.9%, which is considerably lower than the estimate derived in our study. However, in that study, the prevalence of hypertension was based on a prior history of hypertension, which would have underestimated the frequency of hypertension. Among individual country studies, modelled estimates in China have reported similar estimates of PAF, 18.6% and 22.1% (compared to our more conservative estimate of 13.6%), however, a relative risk (RR) of hypertension for dementia was uniformly applied to all ages instead of age-specific RR (as in our study).

### Closure of a distal splenorenal shunt as a therapy for refractory hyperammonaemia in setting of neuropsychiatric symptoms [^7574f44c]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Before the widespread use of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, portal hypertension was addressed by the creation of an operative distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS). DSRS was largely regarded as a safe and effective therapy, though it did have a risk of precipitating hyperammonaemia and hepatic encephalopathy. A woman suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen. This trauma led to portal vein thrombosis, cavernous transformation of the vein and eventually bleeding oesophageal varices from portal hypertension. A DSRS was created to decrease portal hypertension. Years later, she had profound depression with psychomotor slowing in the setting of hyperammonaemia. To reduce hepatic encephalopathy as a contributor to her neuropsychiatric condition, her shunt was closed. The hyperammonaemia resolved and neuropsychiatric symptoms improved. This case highlights several interesting clinical features, including portal hypertension due to chronic portal vein occlusion, cavernous transformation, a surgical DSRS causing hyperammonaemia and hepatic encephalopathy manifesting as neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Post-TIPS encephalopathy: clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^44ed1bce]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of portal hypertension commonly involves the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Despite significant advancement in procedural techniques, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) continues to be one of the most consequential complications following TIPS creation. In this manuscript, we describe in detail several factors associated with the clinical condition of patients and TIPS creation that increase the likelihood of post TIPS development of hepatic encephalopathy. We also discuss the management of the post-TIPS encephalopathic patient.

### Chronic renin-angiotensin system activation induced neuroinflammation: common mechanisms underlying hypertension and dementia? [^dc79a263]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for the pathogenesis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) contributes substantially to neuroinflammation. We propose that neuroinflammation arising from chronic RAS activation can initiate and potentiate the onset of hypertension and related dementia. Neuroinflammation induced by chronic activation of the RAS plays a key role in the pathogenesis of dementia. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β have been reported in brain tissue of vascular dementia patients and animal models of vascular dementia induced by either angiotensin II infusion or transverse aortic coarctation. It is proposed that neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction induced by neuroinflammation lead to cognitive impairment in dementia. The neuroprotective RAS pathway, regulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which converts angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1–7), can attenuate hypertension and dementia. Furthermore, the use of anti-hypertensive medications in preventing dementia or cognitive decline in hypertensive patients and animal models of dementia have mostly been beneficial. Current evidence suggests a strong link between RAS induced neuroinflammation and the onset of hypertension and dementia, which warrants further investigation. Strategies to counteract an overactive RAS and enhance the neuroprotective arm of the RAS may help prevent or improve cognitive impairment associated with hypertension.

### Neurophysiological evidence of cognitive impairment in patients without hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts [^5520fd99]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to test the hypothesis that subclinical cognitive brain dysfunction in cirrhotic patients would deteriorate after a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the absence of clinically detectable hepatic encephalopathy.

Methods

Out of 49 consecutive cirrhotic patients receiving elective TIPS for recurrent variceal hemorrhage, we identified 22 patients who were not encephalopathic and had not undergone liver transplantation at 6-month follow-up and confirmed TIPS patency by Doppler ultrasound. Patients were tested before and 6 months after TIPS implantation using event-related (P300) cognitive evoked potentials, late somatosensory median nerve (N70) potentials, and standard psychometric tests (Mini-Mental State and trailmaking test A). Twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects served as controls.

Results

Relative to controls, patients showed significantly impaired P300 and N70 latencies and abnormal psychometric test results at baseline. Six months after the TIPS, a further impairment of P300 latency was observed (p = 0.005), whereas no relevant changes in N70 latency and psychometric test results occurred.

Conclusions

In cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, neurophysiological signs of cognitive brain dysfunction are detectable in the absence of hepatic encephalopathy. A further subclinical deterioration of cognitive processing was observed 6 months after the TIPS. These findings demonstrate an aggravation of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy after a TIPS.

### Undiagnosed cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy in veterans with dementia… [^15ed2080]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The findings of this study suggest that clinicians treating patients with dementia should investigate a reversible factor associated with cognitive decline, including missed or undiagnosed cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Importance Dementia and hepatic encephalopathy are challenging to distinguish clinically. Undiagnosed cirrhosis in a patient with dementia can lead to missed opportunities to treat HE. The findings of this cohort study suggest that clinicians encountering patients with dementia should be encouraged to screen for cirrhosis using the FIB-4 score to uncover reversible factors associated with cognitive impairment, such as HE, to enhance outcomes. For validation, we extracted data on Richmond VAMC patients included in this cohort to determine the reasons for high FIB-4 scores. Two clinicians reviewed each medical record in detail.

A second cohort of patients with dementia seen by the geriatrics clinic at the Richmond VAMC between January 1 and June 30, 2023, who were still alive underwent a detailed medical records review to examine the presence of high FIB-4 scores and potential causes. Using a high FIB-4 cutoff score of 2. 67, findings were similar for the variables. When using this cutoff value, hypertension was no longer a significant risk factor within the multivariable model, and peripheral vascular disease and PTSD became significant. The combination of high FIB-4 scores and other risk factors for liver disease in patients with dementia raises the possibility that reversible HE could be a factor associated with cognitive impairment.

These findings highlight the potential to enhance cognitive function and quality of life by increasing awareness of risk factors and diagnostic indicators of advanced liver disease that may be associated with HE as a factor or as a differential diagnosis of dementia among clinicians other than liver specialists. The factors associated with high FIB-4 scores in this population differed in important ways from previous studies of the general population. While some traditional risk factors, such as AUD and viral hepatitis, were associated with high FIB-4 scores, others were not. Although the reasons are unclear, diabetes and hyperlipidemia are associated with vascular dementia, independent of liver disease. 18–20 Depression and PTSD, which are known to be occur more often among people with cirrhosis than the general population, were not associated with high FIB-4 scores in this analysis.

### Trends in the incidence of dementia in people with hypertension in the UK 2000 to 2021 [^047b5750]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Dementia is estimated to affect 57 million people globally and cases are predicted to increase to 157 million by 2050. In the United Kingdom (UK), dementia is the leading cause of death among females and second highest cause of death among males. There is no cure for dementia nor treatment that can slow neurodegeneration. Therefore, a focus on identifying risk factors that can be managed is an approach that can prevent or delay up to 40% of dementias.

Hypertension has consistently been associated with an increased risk of dementia. Studies have shown that hypertension starting in midlife (aged ≥ 40 years), may exacerbate the mechanisms of cognitive decline and increase dementia risk through oxidative damage and systemic inflammation. Moreover, hypertension has a direct effect on the risk of atherosclerotic and cerebrovascular disease, which are leasing causes of vascular dementia. Hypertension is common with an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide living with the condition. In 2019, the Health Survey of England estimated that 28% of all adults aged 16 and above were living with hypertension, including 12% with untreated hypertension.

Previous studies describing the trends in dementia incidence rates have drawn from a sample of the general UK population, but have not described trends in those specifically at risk from living with hypertension. Therefore, an epidemiology study describing the trends in dementia incidence among a representative sample of the hypertensive population in the UK is required. This study measured the changes in the annual rate of new dementia occurrence in the hypertensive population over the last 22 years. An investigation of the incidence of dementia in the hypertensive population may serve as the foundation for exploring interventions to slow the effects of hypertension on the rates of incident dementia.

1.1 Aim

The aim of this study was to describe changes in the incidence of dementia in adults with hypertension aged ≥ 40 years between 2000 and 2021 in the UK.

### Neuropsychiatric performance in patients with cirrhosis: who is "normal"? [^e21be910]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis a normal neuropsychiatric performance has been traditionally defined by the absence of any degree of hepatic encephalopathy and/or the absence of psychometric or neurophysiological abnormalities, compared with data from the healthy population. As the understanding and management of end-stage liver disease continues to change, it is our impression that the concept of normal neuropsychiatric performance also needs updating. This review explores novel and more pragmatic interpretations of neuropsychiatric "normality" compared with top personal performance, in terms of risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy or brain failure and in relation with events such as liver transplantation, decompensation, acute-on-chronic liver failure and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic options for cirrhotic portal hypertension [^5cc03143]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertension represents the primary non-neoplastic complication of liver cirrhosis and has life-threatening consequences, such as oesophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension occurs due to increased resistance of the cirrhotic liver vasculature to portal blood flow and is further aggravated by the hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome. Existing knowledge indicates that the profibrogenic phenotype acquired by sinusoidal cells is the initial factor leading to increased hepatic vascular tone and fibrosis, which cause increased vascular resistance and portal hypertension. Data also suggest that the phenotype of hepatic cells could be further impaired due to the altered mechanical properties of the cirrhotic liver itself, creating a deleterious cycle that worsens portal hypertension in the advanced stages of liver disease. In this Review, we discuss recent discoveries in the pathophysiology and treatment of cirrhotic portal hypertension, a condition with few pharmacological treatment options.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^44105809]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as 'brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting'. Symptoms of overt HE include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness – particularly disturbance of the sleep/wake cycle–. In more severe HE, patients may become disorientated, acutely confused and suffer from agitation or coma. Minimal HE, the mildest form of HE, is clinically undetectable and requires the use of psychometric or neurophysiological testing to make a diagnosis.

Overt HE is a common complication of cirrhosis; at diagnosis approximately 10% of patients have HE, and 20–40% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HE during their disease course. In a multicentre study in Europe, of 2145 successive patients at different stages of liver disease 21% had HE. HE is also associated with a poor prognosis; 1-year mortality in patients with HE was 64% in one population-based series. Mortality may also be correlated with HE severity. In addition, HE affects the patient's quality of life, and caregiver burden. There is also accumulating evidence that after apparent resolution of HE persistent cognitive dysfunction may occur.

### A pilot study of a screening tool for pediatric minimal hepatic encephalopathy [^18ccaee5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite the need for monitoring cognition for minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in children with portal hypertension, few screening methods exist. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Perceived Cognitive Function (PedsPCF) item bank, a 43-item parent- and self-report questionnaire, could be a useful screening tool. This study aimed to evaluate the PedsPCF item bank as a screening tool and explore its correlation with other neurocognitive measures and clinical indicators of portal hypertension.

Methods

Pediatric patients with portal hypertension were recruited at Lurie Children's Liver Clinic. A short battery of neuropsychological tests tapping attention, executive functioning, and fine motor speed was administered along with surveys of cognitive functioning (PedsPCF, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function; BRIEF) and quality of life (PROMIS Pediatric-25 Profile).

Results

Eighteen patients participated (ages 8–17). The PedsPCF correlated well with the BRIEF but did not correlate with neurocognitive testing. Qualitative heatmap analysis of the relationship between z-scores and clinical signs of portal hypertension suggests the PedsPCF is less sensitive than the BRIEF. The fine motor task (Grooved Pegboard) appears to offer the highest sensitivity of the tests administered and is also relatively quick and easy to administer.

Conclusions

Elements of the battery show promise in this small pilot sample. The BRIEF and the Grooved Pegboard may hold the most potential for screening in the clinical setting. Further study is necessary to examine this question in a larger multicenter sample.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt does not alter cerebral blood flow [^849a7d5b]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Cirrhosis patients with symptomatic portal hypertension might be effectively treated with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt stent (TIPS). The intervention, however, carries a risk of debilitating portosystemic hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE in cirrhosis might be associated with decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF), and CBF might decrease after TIPS.

Methods

We measured CBF by [(15)O]-water positron emission tomography (PET) in 9 nonencephalopathic cirrhosis patients before and median 11 days after the insertion of TIPS. The PET images were co-registered to magnetic resonance images for region-based analysis.

Results

Pre-TIPS whole-brain CBF varied markedly from very low to high-normal values of 0.28–0.58 mL blood/mL of brain tissue/min. There were no systematic changes in whole-brain or regional CBF after the TIPS treatment (P > .1). No patient had HE after TIPS.

Conclusions

Treating portal hypertension by TIPS in patients with advanced cirrhosis and without HE had no effect on their CBF and seemed not to entail a risk of cerebral hypoperfusion.

Portal hypertension — collateral formation and splanchnic vasodilatation — states that one of the initial consequences of PH is the formation of portosystemic collaterals that develop through the coronary and/or short gastric veins and constitute GEV; research studies have implicated a process of neoangiogenesis; splanchnic vasodilatation can occur concomitant with or even preceding the development of collaterals, leading to increased flow into the gut and into the portal venous system; therefore, even when portal flow is entirely diverted through collaterals, PH persists; conceptually, drugs such as statins reduce PP by improving endothelial dysfunction and, by causing intrahepatic vasodilatation, may improve hepatic blood flow and liver function.

### Management of hepatic encephalopathy: a primer [^eb682ae2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the management of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), including lifestyle modifying strategies and pharmacological interventions.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed through March 2016 was conducted utilizing the keywords hepatic encephalopathy, ammonia, and cirrhosis All published articles evaluating treatments for HE were considered.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Available English-language data from reviews, abstracts, presentations, and clinical trials of the treatment of HE in humans were reviewed; relevant clinical data were selected and included.

Data Synthesis

HE is a prevalent complication of portal hypertension and cirrhosis that results in altered mental status and neuropsychiatric impairment. Although the pathogenesis has not been elucidated, numerous treatment options exist. This review will explore the role of dietary interventions and supplements, including use of zinc, acetyl-l-carnitine, and probiotics, in the management of HE. Additionally, the use of various ammonia-lowering agents will be evaluated. The nonabsorbable disaccharides represent first-line therapies for the management and prophylaxis of HE; rifaximin use has been demonstrated to be effective for both treatment and prophylaxis of HE symptoms, with use relegated to those patients who fail to respond to or tolerate the nonabsorbable disaccharides. In light of toxicities associated with the use of neomycin and metronidazole, recent guidelines recommend both as alternatives for the treatment of HE, with the use of vancomycin discouraged.

Conclusion

Although numerous treatment options are available, management of HE remains a clinical challenge. Additional research is needed to explore the pathogenesis and better understand the role of pharmacotherapy in managing this condition.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^a9be14c2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — postoperative portal hypertension and medication safety in cirrhosis advises the following: Aggressively avoid exacerbations of portal hypertension and associated complications in the postoperative period. Appropriate measures include close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of volume excess or depletion, and Excess volume can increase the risk of variceal and other portal hypertensive bleeding. Due to disturbed metabolism and elimination, patients with cirrhosis are at especially high risk for medication-related complications; generally, use opiates at lower doses and with longer dosing intervals than in the general population, use only short-acting benzodiazepines, and Avoidance of constipation should be a priority in the management of these patients to minimize flares of hepatic encephalopathy in the postoperative period, noting that In patients who can take medications orally, rifaximin generally causes less bowel distention than nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose). Avoid medications that might be toxic in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Do not use NSAIDs because they can impair renal blood flow, patients with cirrhosis can be susceptible to acetaminophen toxicity at doses lower than those that may cause toxicity in the general population, and Do not prescribe combination opiate/acetaminophen pain relievers to take home after surgery because the patient may be unaware of the presence of acetaminophen in various over-the-counter products and unintentional acetaminophen overdose and hepatotoxicity can result.

### AASLD practice guideline on noninvasive liver disease assessment of portal hypertension [^aa60d942]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) for portal hypertension — rationale and limitations are described: NILDAs are attractive because "the presence and degree of portal hypertension is typically associated with poor clinical outcomes such as decompensation and death", and "NILDAs are most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis)", such that "it follows that NILDAs should readily detect portal hypertension, especially CSPH". Limitations include that "the correlation between fibrosis and degree of portal hypertension may not correlate", that prediction of esophageal varices "is not addressed in this guideline" and that "the additional confounder — variation in the propensity to develop esophageal varices in the setting of portal hypertension — is difficult to overcome", and that "the pathogenesis of severe portal hypertension is complex".

### Dementia frequently coexists with hepatic encephalopathy but not other cirrhosis complications in US veterans [^e1fdda68]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common decompensating event in patients with cirrhosis. Because of the aging population of patients with cirrhosis, differentiating HE from nonhepatic etiologies of cognitive impairment, such as dementia, is increasingly important.

Methods

Veterans with cirrhosis were identified via International Classification of Diseases -10 codes between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2021, using the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Baseline characteristics were compared between cohorts based on the presence vs absence of dementia. Factors associated with having a diagnosis of dementia were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, adjusting for demographics, comorbid illnesses, cirrhosis etiology, and cirrhosis complications.

Results

A total of 71,552 veterans with cirrhosis were identified, of which, 5,647 (7.89%) veterans had a diagnosis of dementia. Veterans with dementia were older, more frequently White, urban located, and diagnosed with alcohol-related cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, brain trauma, and cerebrovascular disease more frequently. On multivariable analysis, the presence of any decompensating event was associated with dementia. Multivariable analysis of individual decompensating events revealed HE to be associated with a dementia diagnosis, but not ascites, independent of other risk factors analyzed.

Discussion

Dementia is commonly diagnosed in patients with cirrhosis and correlates with a diagnosis of HE, independent of alcohol use, brain injury, age, and other metabolic risk factors. Dementia did not correlate with other decompensating events. Increased awareness of the overlap between dementia and HE, as well as reliable diagnostic and treatment strategies, is needed for the aging population of veterans with cirrhosis.

### Sinistral portal hypertension: presentation, radiological findings, and treatment options-a case report [^9ad67abd]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Sinistral portal hypertension occurs when a pathological process causes occlusion of the splenic vein. The resultant elevated splenic bed venous pressure causes formation of gastric varices which can lead to hematemesis as a common presentation for this disease process. We present a case of sinistral portal hypertension in a patient with acute hematemesis as the primary presentation. Despite the challenging diagnosis process, the patient underwent splenectomy and was managed appropriately according to previously published literature.

### Association of hepatorenal function biomarkers with depression risk in geriatric psychiatry inpatient: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^a1dea82d]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed association may reflect intertwined organ-brain communication mechanisms underlying depression pathogenesis. Clinical studies have documented elevated cerebral ammonia levels in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Impaired hepatic ammonia clearance precipitates hyperammonemia, which facilitates neuropsychiatric manifestations through ammonia accumulation in the central nervous system. Hyperammonemia impair glutamate processing in the hippocampus by disrupting astrocyte function — specifically reducing glutamate clearance and glutamine production. This coincides with decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein vital for brain health, ultimately contributing to cognitive issues and depressive symptoms in liver disease patients. Notably, as the primary substrate initiating the urea cycle and a key regulator of nitrogen homeostasis, impaired hepatic processing of ammonia directly disrupts systemic BUN metabolism. This pathophysiological cascade underlies the association between reduced BUN levels and depressive vulnerability identified in our study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the liver-brain axis constitutes a critical pathological substrate underlying the development of depressive behaviors. The BUN/Cr ratio serves as a validated biomarker for renal function assessment, reflecting hydration status, protein catabolism, and renal parenchymal injury patterns. Experimental evidence from murine CKD models demonstrates that cerebral oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with depressive-like phenotypes. In CKD patients, uremic toxin accumulation, particularly tryptophan-derived indoxyl sulfate, exacerbates neuroinflammation and apoptosis through astrocytic dysfunction and blood–brain barrier disruption, thereby elevating the risk of depression. Chronic neuroinflammation coupled with serotonin depletion, both driven by uremic toxin retention, may constitute a central mechanism underlying depression onset and therapeutic resistance in CKD. Beyond classical toxin pathways, recent evidence suggests that glymphatic dysfunction may be a key pathway linking hepatic/renal impairment to mood disorders. This intracranial clearance system, reliant on cerebrospinal-interstitial fluid exchange via perivascular spaces, eliminates neurotoxic proteins (e.g. β-amyloid, tau). In hepatic encephalopathy models, portal hypertension triggers systemic inflammation and cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction, suppressing AQP4 polarization in astrocytic endfeet and disrupting glymphatic flow. Concurrently, uremic milieu in renal failure impairs AQP4 function, exacerbating toxic protein accumulation. The elevated prevalence of depression in patients with hepatic-renal impairment observed in this study may be closely linked to neuroinflammatory cascades secondary to compromised glymphatic clearance efficiency.

### Update on cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: from etiopathogenesis to treatment [^b0874bbf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension and hemodynamic changes

The main pathophysiological cause of cardiac dysfunction is the maximally activated neurohumoral axis and associated cardiac changes. This pathophysiological response is well known in cardiology, and therapeutic approaches aim to interrupt this vicious circle ("Fantastic Four" for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, HFrEF). The pathophysiological cause of CCM in patients with liver cirrhosis is portal hypertension (Fig. 1) leading to hyperdynamic circulation, intestinal obstruction and a subclinical inflammatory state, as well as hepatocellular insufficiency with defective synthesis or metabolism of several vasoactive mediators. Two main mechanisms contribute to portal hypertension: first, increased resistance to portal blood flow, and second, raised portal blood flow as a counter-reaction to maintain metabolic hemostasis. The progressive fibrotic transformation of liver parenchyma leads to changes in hepatic and vascular architecture that ultimately increase resistance to portal blood flow and represent the initial mechanism of portal hypertension. The elevation of resistance occurs dynamically at the intrahepatic vascular level. Both activated stellate cells in the hepatic sinusoids, which acquire more contractile properties, and an imbalance between vasoconstrictive and vasodilating mediators, result in a net intrahepatic vasoconstriction leading to an increase in vascular resistance, and can induce rapid changes in portal pressure. The best studied vasoactive mediator in this context is nitric oxide (NO). Impaired NO production in sinusoidal endothelial cells due to increased caveolin expression is thought to be the main cause of intrahepatic vascular resistance. The elevation of portal pressure leads subsequently to changes in the peripheral circulation, particularly in the splanchnic bed. In contrast to the intrahepatic circulation, the splanchnic circulation is characterized by raised endothelial NO production. In addition to NO, other mediators have also been associated with splanchnic arterial vasodilation, including carbon monoxide (CO) and endogenous cannabinoids (ECs). Insufficient hepatic degradation or escape of vasodilators through portosystemic shunts as the disease progresses maintains the vasodilatory state. The vasodilation in the splanchnic capillaries and arterioles increases portal flow, which, in combination with increased intrahepatic vascular resistance, eventually leads to portal hypertension (forward and backward portal hypertension). As the splanchnic area accounts for approximately 25% of peripheral resistance, vasodilation leads to a reduction in effective circulating blood volume, which subsequently activates several neurohumoral mechanisms for circulatory regulation (i.e. sympathetic nervous system (SNS), renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and non-osmotic release of vasopressin). To maintain circulatory function, plasma volume is increased and the SNS is activated. As liver cirrhosis progresses, these compensatory mechanisms are unable to counteract the vasodilatory state and systemic blood pressure progressively decreases. The maximum activation of these compensatory mechanisms leads to an increase in cardiac output, resulting in a hyperdynamic circulatory state. These changes occur at rest to maintain organ perfusion, and cardiac decompensation may occur during exercise. In summary, the maximal activation of neurohumoral mechanisms over time is responsible for the systolic, diastolic and electromechanical changes in the cirrhotic heart, known as CCM.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with portal hypertension (PoPH) — definition and epidemiology: PAH associated with portal hypertension is commonly referred to as PoPH and should not be confused with hepatopulmonary syndrome; PoPH is associated with portal hypertension and not necessarily liver disease, though cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension and PoPH is therefore most frequently encountered in cirrhosis. Approximately 1–5% of patients with portal hypertension develop PAH, and the risk appears largely independent of the aetiology of liver disease.

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^d6decdd3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding). Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding) are important, given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis (eg increased odds of short-term mortality). Hepatic encephalopathy can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy (eg rifaximin plus lactulose) in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c00c343f]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Neurovasculome in stroke, Alzheimer disease (AD), and related dementias — Abundant epidemiological evidence implicates neurovascular dysfunction as a risk factor for age-related cognitive decline, vascular cognitive impairment, AD, and related dementias. Of the 12 modifiable risk factors identified by the Lancet Commission with the strongest evidence for potential prevention of dementia, 9 are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia alter neurovascular regulation and increase the risk for dementia. It is likely that neurovascular dysfunction mediates at least some of the associations of these risk factors with dementia, and for many of these risk factors, the elevation in risk can be detected in midlife, suggesting that early neurovascular dysfunction begins several decades before clinical symptoms.

### AASLD practice guideline on noninvasive liver disease assessment of portal hypertension [^abd8e5b9]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guideline — types of noninvasive biomarkers (blood-based biomarkers) notes current evidence and limitations. Blood-based markers have received extensive attention for the assessment of fibrosis, and a limited number of studies have examined blood-based markers as for assessment of portal hypertension. For assessment of CSPH, the blood-based marker that has received the most attention is the platelet count by virtue of the fact that portal hypertension causes splenomegaly, which in turn leads to platelet sequestration, and thrombocytopenia. However, blood-based tests, including platelets, are limited by a variety of clinical factors (i.e., infection, splenectomy, bone marrow suppression, etc.), and use of the platelet count to estimate the severity of portal hypertension may be particularly affected by systemic disorders that affect platelets, such as primary bone marrow diseases, which may also lead to thrombocytopenia.

### CDC grand rounds: public health strategies to prevent and treat strokes [^357092a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Risk Factors and Special Populations

Approximately 75% of persons who have a stroke have hypertension, making hypertension the most potent modifiable risk factor for stroke. Hypertension causes weakening of the arteries and can lead to either of the two types of stroke: ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Currently, 29.3% of U.S. adults aged ≥ 18 years have hypertension, and only about half of these adults have their blood pressure controlled (54%). Hypertension is more prevalent among non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) than non-Hispanic whites (whites) (41.2% compared with 28%). Blacks are two to three times more likely to have a stroke than are whites and do so at an earlier age than whites; hypertension is thought to be a more potent risk factor for stroke among blacks and Hispanics than among whites. Increasing evidence indicates that hypertension at older ages is an important contributor to vascular cognitive impairment or vascular dementia, which often coexists with other forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies indicate that hypertension might potentiate the impact of Alzheimer's disease and its role in causing microbleeds, microinfarcts, white matter disease, and multiple small strokes that might not be clinically noticeable at the time but can lead to dementia, as well as possible involvement in the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Approximately two thirds of adults aged > 60 years have hypertension, putting them at increased risk for both stroke and dementia. Having hypertension in mid-life (ages 45–64 years) is strongly associated with risk for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia later in life.

### Portal hypertension [^25cbf769]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Report on significant advances in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of the complications of portal hypertension that have occurred in the last year.

Recent Findings

The specific areas reviewed refer to experimental studies aimed at modifying the factors that lead to portal hypertension (increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and splanchnic vasodilatation) and recent advances in the diagnosis and management of the complications of portal hypertension. The specific complications reviewed in this paper are varices and variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis, treatment of the acute episode, and secondary prophylaxis), ascites and some of its complications (hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax), hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Summary

Important studies, mostly prospective, regarding the management of the complications of portal hypertension are reviewed, including trials that demonstrate the value of the hepatic venous pressure gradient in predicting these complications, a trial of beta-blockers in patients with small varices, a randomized trial of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt using covered stents and another pilot study using this shunt in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome, a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing early variceal rebleeding, and a trial of synbiotic therapy in hepatic encephalopathy. These trials will contribute to advancing the practice of hepatology and defining future research areas.

Pregnancy with chronic liver disease — physiologic changes relevant to portal hypertension include increased splanchnic vasodilation, decreased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, increased portal flow and intrahepatic resistance, and an overall exacerbation of portal hypertension, with clinical consequences of increased variceal size and risk of variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^a33fe614]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Pathophysiological basis of pharmacological therapy — in cirrhosis, the accumulation of fibrous tissue and nodule formation with consequent vascular distortion lead to an increase in intrahepatic vascular resistance and elevated portal pressure; these structural changes are accompanied by splanchnic vasodilation that augments portal blood flow, and a dynamic component caused by increased intrahepatic vascular tone, mostly caused by reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, accounts for about 30% of the total increase in intrahepatic resistance.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^a21a0e93]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. Symptoms include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness. Overt (symptomatic) hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis that is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present to healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we developed a series of 'consensus points' to provide some guidance on management.

Methods

Using a modified 'Delphi' process, consensus statements were developed that summarize our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Points on which full consensus could not be reached are also discussed.

Results

Our recommendations emphasize the role of all healthcare providers in the identification of cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis and provide guidance on steps that might be considered to make a diagnosis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, treatment recommendations are summarized. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy can have a significant impact on patients; however, in most circumstances identification and management of minimal hepatic encephalopathy remains the responsibility of specialists in liver diseases.

Conclusion

Our opinion statements aim to define the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. We suggest that these recommendations be considered further by colleagues in other disciplines and hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with cirrhosis and with a 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment through to a formal diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Is there an association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cognitive function? A systematic review [^55ad03e1]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognised as the most prevalent liver disease affecting approximately 30% of adults in Australia with similar, high rates in the United States. The burden of NAFLD continues to rise significantly in Australia with current estimates of 5.5 million cases in 2019, with expectations of seven million cases by 2030. NAFLD is defined as a spectrum of diseases related to hepatic fat deposition, ranging from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) (simple steatosis) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to increased fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Progression from NAFLD to NASH is often described using the "two hit" hypothesis. The "first hit" consists of lipid accumulation of fatty acids, increasing susceptibility of hepatocytes to secondary insults such as oxidative stress, insulin resistance and over production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This can lead to the "second hit" which promotes steatohepatitis, chronic inflammation and fibrosis. NAFLD occurs in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and is associated with a range of common chronic disease risk factors such as insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity and visceral fat accumulation, and dyslipidaemia. Such risk factors are known to be elucidated by inflammation and oxidative stress, which also play a role in extrahepatic diseases, including central nervous system diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia.

The global number of individuals living with dementia is 50 million, with the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia rising and estimated to increase amongst older adults (60 years and above) to approximately 2 billion by 2050, accounting for 22% of the world's population. Cognitive function encompasses multiple mental abilities and skills in reasoning, perception, memory, verbal and mathematical ability and problem solving. Cognitive impairments have been associated with reduced ability to perform complex tasks such as driving and work-related activities leading to impaired quality of life and in more serious cases, premature mortality. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) frequently co-exist with NAFLD and are also considered risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia which are increased with ageing. Individuals with NAFLD have high rates of metabolic syndrome components including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, abdominal obesity and insulin resistance, and there is also accumulating evidence that individuals with NAFLD have an increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis and carotid intima media thickness; all of which have been reported to contribute towards cognitive impairment.

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^f254c290]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities and motor disturbances in patients with advanced liver disease. It is estimated to occur in 30% to 45% of patients with liver cirrhosis and in 10% to 50% of patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. It can be seen in cancer patients due to multiple factors. Early diagnosis and treatment are important but can be challenging, especially in mild forms with subtle findings. This article reviews the pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, grading, and management of hepatic encephalopathy.

LIVER DISEASES AND DEMENTIA

It is recognized that hepatic functionality should be considered when Aβ balance is addressed. This is reflected in the situation of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) where the recipient passes through an anhepatic phase to reperfusion of the new organ. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is observed in 11% to 44% of OLT patients and is unrelated with the success of a surgery. It is associated with an increase in the serum biomarkers of dementia including Aβ protein 24 h after surgery, presumably reflecting alterations in the clearance of Aβ as a result of OLT.

90% of people who die from liver disease are under the age of 70, but the majority of AD cases occur late in life (> 65 years). However, a recent large epidemiological study demonstrated that comorbidities significantly associated with mild cognitive impairment and dementia were cirrhosis (OR 3.29, CI 1.29–8.41), cerebrovascular disease (OR 3.35, CI 2.62–4.28), asthma (OR 1.56, CI 1.07–2.27), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.24, CI 1.07–1.44). In addition, some studies have shown associations of AD with specific liver diseases.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

Chronic HCV infection has been found to be associated with dementia in a large population-based cohort (Hazard ratio 1.36 [95% CI 1.27–1.42]). More recently, a predictor of cirrhosis in chronic HCV infection, an elevated aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio, has been reported to be associated with AD diagnosis (Odds ratio: 7.932). ApoE, a critical player in Aβ homeostasis, is intimately involved in production of infectious HCV particles and is important in HCV cell entry. HCV may cross the BBB leading to neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric symptoms. We have reported ApoE deficiency in HCV associated depression. Interestingly low plasma levels of ApoE are associated with increased risk of future AD and all dementia in the general population, independent of ɛ 2/ ɛ 3/ ɛ 4 APOE genotype.
