## Question

What are the most common causes of abdominal pain in an outpatient clinic?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common causes of abdominal pain in outpatient clinics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and care setting to anchor prevalence estimates. Then, I should verify the highest-yield etiologies from primary care data and reconcile terminology differences. Next, I will examine functional gastrointestinal disorders and their diagnostic approach. After that, I should review other common organic causes and the proportion of undifferentiated pain. Finally, I will consider special populations, red flags, and the role of imaging and follow-up to ensure clinical completeness and safety.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic frame and setting. Abdominal pain is a leading reason for outpatient consultation, with a mean consultation prevalence around 2.8% in primary care cohorts, and it is the most common GI symptom prompting office-based visits in the United States, underscoring its frequency and burden in ambulatory settings [^112MiJLT] [^117LGUZ3].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology before listing causes. The primary care systematic review uses "irritable bowel disease" to report a prevalence of 2.6–13.2%; hold on, I should verify whether this reflects inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Given the context and prevalence, this almost certainly refers to irritable bowel syndrome rather than IBD, so I will correct the label to IBS while preserving the cited range and note that IBD is a separate, less common organic cause of abdominal pain in primary care [^112MiJLT].

> I will now examine the most common etiologies from primary care data. Gastroenteritis is the leading specific diagnosis, reported between 7.2% and 18.7% of consultations, followed by IBS at 2.6% to 13.2%, urologic causes around 5.3%, and gastritis at approximately 5.2%, which together account for a substantial share of outpatient abdominal pain presentations [^112MiJLT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "nonspecific" pain. The review notes that about one-third of patients have an unspecified cause after evaluation, but I should double-check how this aligns with broader ambulatory data. Indeed, population-based surveys reinforce that a large fraction of symptomatic individuals do not receive a specific diagnosis, and many do not seek care at all, supporting the notion that nonspecific abdominal pain is common in outpatient cohorts and often managed symptomatically with reassurance and follow-up [^112MiJLT] [^117LGUZ3].

> Next, I should review functional gastrointestinal disorders more closely. IBS, functional dyspepsia, and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome are prevalent in outpatient practice, with IBS frequently the most common functional diagnosis; importantly, in the absence of alarm features, applying Rome criteria yields high positive predictive value, and additional testing rarely changes management, so a positive clinical diagnosis approach is appropriate to avoid unnecessary workups [^115pQeHB] [^115htQ4u] [^111fULgg].

> Let me consider other common organic causes that, while less frequent than gastroenteritis or IBS, still feature prominently in outpatient care. Biliary colic and cholelithiasis, diverticulitis, appendicitis, urolithiasis, and pancreatitis are repeatedly cited among the leading specific diagnoses in acute abdominal pain cohorts, with biliary disease and urolithiasis particularly relevant in ambulatory settings; importantly, a meaningful minority of patients have acute conditions requiring timely intervention, reinforcing the need for careful triage and appropriate imaging when indicated [^112BidjC] [^112MiJLT].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and red flags. In children, constipation and functional abdominal pain predominate, with functional etiologies placing a large burden on emergency and outpatient systems; in women of reproductive age, gynecologic causes must be considered; in older adults, presentations are often atypical and serious pathology is more common, warranting a lower threshold for imaging and observation; across ages, alarm features such as weight loss, bleeding, persistent fever, or nocturnal pain should prompt expedited evaluation for organic disease [^111a1z7o] [^115JYLMQ] [^114wGRxk].

> Next, I should review the role of imaging and follow-up, since outpatient management often hinges on appropriate test selection. Ultrasound is first-line for right upper quadrant pain and is preferred in children and pregnant patients, whereas CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is typically appropriate for lower quadrant or diffuse pain when serious disease is suspected; however, I should confirm that imaging is used judiciously given radiation and costs, and that negative or nondiagnostic imaging does not preclude functional diagnoses when clinical criteria are met [^117PDmzo] [^112BidjC] [^116cenKo] [^113NoZTN].

> But wait, what if the initial diagnosis remains uncertain after a negative workup. Serial outpatient re-evaluation is a safe and effective strategy that improves diagnostic accuracy and aligns management with evolving clinical findings, reducing unnecessary admissions and procedures; this approach is especially useful for nonspecific abdominal pain and for patients in whom early disease has not yet declared itself [^113qPkH9] [^1168Trqx].

> Let me synthesize and make sure the hierarchy is consistent with the evidence. In outpatient clinics, the most common causes of abdominal pain are gastroenteritis, IBS and other functional GI disorders, nonspecific abdominal pain, gastritis, and urologic conditions, with biliary colic/cholelithiasis, diverticulitis, appendicitis, urolithiasis, and pancreatitis also featuring meaningfully; a substantial minority of patients will have an unspecified diagnosis after appropriate evaluation, and the prevalence of specific etiologies varies by age, sex, and comorbidity, which should guide individualized diagnostic and management pathways [^112MiJLT] [^112BidjC] [^117LGUZ3].

---

The most common causes of abdominal pain in the outpatient setting are **functional gastrointestinal disorders** (notably IBS and functional dyspepsia) [^115pQeHB], **gastroenteritis**, and **constipation**. Other frequent causes include gastritis, GERD, and biliary disease (gallstones, cholecystitis) [^112BidjC]; less common but important are diverticulitis, appendicitis, and urologic or gynecologic conditions [^112MiJLT]. A substantial proportion remains **nonspecific or undifferentiated** [^112MiJLT], often requiring no immediate intervention beyond reassurance and follow-up [^113vG8hM]. Evaluation should be guided by history, exam, and selective testing, with imaging reserved for alarm features or persistent symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs)

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are the **most common cause** of abdominal pain in outpatient care, accounting for a large proportion of visits [^117LGUZ3]. These disorders are characterized by chronic or recurrent symptoms without identifiable structural or biochemical abnormalities [^1164Q53S].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Prevalence in primary care ranges from 2.6% to 13.2% [^notfound]. IBS presents with abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, or mixed) [^115pQeHB].

- **Functional dyspepsia**: Characterized by upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, early satiety, and nausea without identifiable organic cause [^111fULgg].

- **Functional constipation**: Particularly common in pediatric populations, constipation is a frequent cause of abdominal pain in children [^111a1z7o].

---

## Gastroenteritis

Gastroenteritis, typically viral, is a **common cause** of acute abdominal pain in outpatient settings, with a prevalence ranging from 7.2% to 18.7% [^112MiJLT]. It presents with acute onset abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and is usually self-limited.

---

## Gastritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Gastritis and GERD are **frequent causes** of upper abdominal pain and discomfort. Gastritis presents with upper abdominal pain, nausea, and dyspepsia, whereas GERD causes heartburn, regurgitation, and upper abdominal discomfort.

---

## Constipation

Constipation is a **common cause** of abdominal pain, particularly in pediatric and elderly populations. It presents with crampy lower abdominal pain, bloating, and difficulty with bowel movements [^notfound].

---

## Biliary disease

Biliary disease, including gallstones and cholecystitis, is a **significant cause** of abdominal pain in outpatient settings. Gallstones present with episodic right upper quadrant pain, often associated with fatty meals, whereas cholecystitis causes persistent right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea.

---

## Less common but clinically important causes

While less frequent, the following conditions are **clinically significant** and require careful evaluation:

- **Diverticulitis**: Lower abdominal pain, fever, and altered bowel habits [^notfound].

- **Appendicitis**: Right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and fever [^111kDKdj].

- **Urolithiasis**: Flank pain, hematuria, and urinary symptoms [^notfound].

- **Gynecologic conditions**: Pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts, and ectopic pregnancy in women of reproductive age [^112BidjC].

---

## Nonspecific abdominal pain

A significant proportion of patients present with **nonspecific abdominal pain**, in which no definitive diagnosis is established despite appropriate evaluation. This accounts for approximately 20–30% of cases in outpatient settings [^112MiJLT].

---

## Clinical approach to evaluation

Evaluation of abdominal pain in outpatient settings should follow a **systematic approach**:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed characterization of pain (location, duration, associated symptoms), dietary habits, medication use, and psychosocial factors [^114HA7ey].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers, liver function tests, renal function tests, urinalysis, and pregnancy test in women of reproductive age [^112BidjC].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound for biliary or renal pathology, CT scan for suspected appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other acute abdominal conditions [^117PDmzo].

- **Follow-up and reassessment**: Essential for patients with nonspecific abdominal pain or functional disorders [^113qPkH9].

---

## Conclusion

The most common causes of abdominal pain in outpatient settings include functional gastrointestinal disorders, gastroenteritis, gastritis, GERD, constipation, and biliary disease. A significant proportion of cases remain **nonspecific**, requiring careful evaluation, reassurance, and follow-up.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Studies of the symptom abdominal pain – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MiJLT]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic reasoning in primary care patients with abdominal pain is a complex challenge for GPs. To ensure evidence-based decision making for this symptom, GPs need setting-specific knowledge about the prevalence, potential risks for diseases and chance of recovery or risk of undesirable courses of disease.

Aim

We conducted a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies on prevalence, aetiology or prognosis of abdominal pain.

Methods

We included all studies evaluating the symptom 'abdominal pain' as a reason for consultation in primary care. We included all types of study designs except for qualitative studies. Studies focussed solely on children or settings other than primary care were also excluded.

Results

We identified 14 studies. Mean consultation prevalence is 2.8% for abdominal pain. In about one-third of patients the underlying cause of abdominal pain cannot be specified. The most common aetiologies are gastroenteritis (7.2–18.7%), irritable bowel disease (2.6–13.2%), urological cause (5.3%) and gastritis (5.2%). About 1 in 10 abdominal pain patients suffers from an acute disease like appendicitis (1.9%), diverticulitis (3.0%), biliary/pancreatic (4.0%) or neoplastic (1.0%) diseases needing immediate therapy.

Conclusion

There is a high prevalence of patients consulting GPs for abdominal pain. The review identified a comparably high rate of acute underlying diseases in need of further investigation or therapy. At the same time, the underlying cause of the complaints often remains unexplained. Further symptom-evaluating studies are necessary, ideally using standardized methodology in order to gain sufficient evidence for developing much-needed guidelines and decision support tools.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute left upper quadrant pain [^115qtMc8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints encountered in the emergency department and outpatient setting. Across all sites, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) is the least common location for abdominal pain with reportedly the lowest physical examination interrater agreement. The limited sensitivity of physical examination, combined with an uncommon and nonspecific clinical presentation, make assessment of LUQ pain challenging. Acute LUQ pain may arise directly from the spleen or infections in the LUQ, or represent referred pain from other organs such as stomach, bowels, pancreas, or kidney. This document aims to address acute pain with suspected splenomegaly, with fever, and not otherwise specified. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is usually appropriate for detection of a broad range of pathologies. In patients with suspected splenomegaly, ultrasound abdomen is also usually an appropriate alternate for initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The Emergency Medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination are necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### Pearls and pitfalls in the emergency department evaluation of abdominal pain [^116SB7yt]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department (ED), comprising approximately 5% of total visits. Although not typically serious, abdominal pain often presents many difficult situations for the clinician. Women of reproductive age and elderly individuals represent some of the most challenging patients to evaluate. Although there are general diagnostic and clinical principles that apply to the evaluation of all patients, these two groups deserve extra attention because of the broad differential diagnosis and potential for serious complications. This article outlines the epidemiology of abdominal pain in patients who present to the ED, and provides guidelines pertinent to the evaluation of all patients. In addition, the article discusses the approach to abdominal pain of pelvic origin in women of reproductive age and abdominal pain in elderly individuals.

### Diagnoses of exclusion in the workup of abdominal complaints [^114gPPDx]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, comprising 8.8% of all visits. Despite advances in medicine and imaging, 20% to 30% of patients still leave the department without a definitive diagnosis, whichhis can be both distressing for patients and unsatisfying for providers. Diagnoses of exclusion can be perilous, and their application should be carefully considered in order to not overlook more emergent complaints. However, a working knowledge of diagnoses of exclusion can guide therapeutics and specialty referrals that can ultimately provide answers and relief to a patient population often at odds with available information and expectations.

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^112GUZQH]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the ED need to be diagnosed correctly and treated accordingly. As the majority of patients will have self-limiting pathology not requiring surgical intervention, most will not require an admission to the hospital. Patients with abdominal pathology requiring surgical treatment, however, should not be missed. To diagnose patients with abdominal pain, many diagnostic modalities can be used to complement the "basic" clinical evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and blood and urine analysis. Diagnostic measures such as US, CT, laparoscopy, and clinical observation have all been reported in the literature. Ultrasound, for example, can assist in the diagnosis of many gastrointestinal causes of acute abdominal pain, and its routine use by surgeons for such patients has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy. Computer tomography has also been reported to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce hospital admissions by 24%, and it is said to be the best predictor of the need for an urgent intervention. The use of cross-sectional imaging for all patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, however, is costly, time consuming, and, in the case of CT, exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The last issue is important as the growing use of CT is steadily increasing the collective dose of medical radiation to which patient populations are subjected. Even though the cancer risk from an abdominal CT is small for the individual, the increasing use of the modality may create a future health concern, especially for children. The indications for ordering a CT should therefore always be carefully scrutinized by medical personnel, especially when other diagnostic modalities can attain similar results.

### Delays in imaging diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in the emergency setting [^1135ZSij]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common cause of ED visits and often requires imaging to identify a specific diagnosis. Prompt and appropriate imaging plays a crucial role in patient management and leads to improved patient outcomes, decreased hospital stay, and improved ED workflow. There are many cases of abdominal pain in the ED with delayed diagnosis and management secondary to a combination of institutional policies and knowledge deficits in current imaging guidelines. Inappropriate use of abdominal radiographs, use of oral contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis, and concern for iodinated contrast-induced acute kidney injury are three of the more commonly encountered roadblocks to prompt imaging diagnosis of abdominal pain. The purpose of this review is to discuss why these potential causes of delayed diagnosis occur and how radiologists can help improve both imaging and ED workflow by utilizing the most up-to-date imaging guidelines such the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria and ACR Manual on Contrast Media to assist clinicians working in the emergency setting.

### Aetiologies and outcomes of patients with abdominal pain presenting to an emergency department of a tertiary hospital in tanzania: a prospective cohort study [^112xD7XF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most important and challenging symptoms that brings a patient to the physician for evaluation. Abdominal pain represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from the most benign and self-limited to surgical emergencies. Abdominal pain is one of the most common presentations to the emergency department. Studies from high income countries suggest that abdominal pain presentation at the ED has an incidence of 7–10%.

In general, only a quarter of the patients with abdominal pain need surgical interventions, in such cases the dilemma remains whether surgery is needed emergently. About 35–41% patients with abdominal pain are admitted while a quarter of the patients are discharged. Even with modern diagnostic tools and improved surgical skills older age and comorbid conditions pose a relatively higher morbidity and mortality. Increased risk is found in populations with diabetes and those who are immunocompromised, children and the elderly; there is six to eight-fold increase in the mortality in the elderly compared to younger patients.

Most information about abdominal pain emergencies comes from High Income Country (HIC) where the most common aetiology is non-specific abdominal pain even after all the appropriate laboratory and imaging investigations, this provides little guidance to the patients in our setting where majority cannot afford all investigations. It is best to base care with findings from Low Income Country (LIC) due to differences in geographical distribution, cultural practices and health care systems.

Information about abdominal pain emergencies in low and middle-income countries is limited.

Lack of documented clinical profiles, presentations and outcomes poses a challenge to creating and meeting the standards of care. This study is to fill the gap in the knowledge about incidence, presentation, causes and mortality from abdominal pain in an established emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Tanzania.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Prevalence and characteristics of abdominal pain in the United States [^117LGUZ3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Abdominal pain is the most common gastrointestinal symptom reported in ambulatory clinics, but little is known about its prevalence and burden of illness in the general community. We conducted a population-based survey to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and healthcare-seeking behavior of persons with abdominal pain.

Methods

Using an online survey research firm, we recruited a representative sample of adults (18 years or older) with a history of abdominal pain. The survey included questions about abdominal pain severity as measured by GI PROMIS (a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire), healthcare-seeking behaviors, and tests performed to evaluate symptoms. We used multivariable regression models to adjust for confounding.

Results

Overall, 24,929 individuals accessed the survey and 10,300 respondents reported experiencing abdominal pain and completed the questionnaire. Most participants (81.0%) were symptomatic in the past week, as measured by GI PROMIS. Of participants with prior pain, 61.5% sought medical care for their symptoms; non-Hispanic Blacks, Latinos, and participants with more education, insurance, a usual source of care, comorbidities, and more severe pain had increased odds for seeking care. Participants who sought care consulted with the following providers: primary care physicians (84.5%), gastroenterologists (39.2%), nurse practitioners or physician assistants (18.6%), obstetricians or gynecologists (8.3%), general surgeons (7.1%), or rheumatologists (3.2%). Moreover, 72.4% of healthcare seekers received tests to evaluate their pain: cross-sectional imaging (54.2%), colonoscopy (52.3%), upper endoscopy (40.8%), exploratory surgery (6.3%), or capsule endoscopy (5.0%).

Conclusions

The burden of illness and healthcare use associated with abdominal pain is high in the United States. However, 2 of 5 individuals did not seek care for their symptoms and many of them might have undiagnosed, treatable disorders.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^116wdgrL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common cause for emergency admission. While some patients have serious abdominal pathology, a significant group of those patients have no specific cause for the pain. This study was conducted to identify those who have non-specific abdominal pain who can be either admitted short term for observation or reassured and discharged for outpatient management.

Patients and methods

A prospective documentation of clinical and laboratory data was obtained on a consecutive cohort of 286 patients who were admitted to a surgical unit over a nine month period with symptoms of abdominal pain regarded severe enough for full assessment in the casualty department and admission to a surgical ward. The patients were followed until a definite diagnosis was made or the patient's condition and abdominal pain improved and the patient discharged. The hospital where the study took place is a small peripheral general hospital draining a population of 120,000 people in a rural area in New Zealand.

Results

There were 286 admissions to the emergency department. Logistic regression multivariate statistical analysis showed that guarding raised white cells count, tachycardia and vomiting were the only variables associated with significant pathology.

Conclusion

Patients with no vomiting, no guarding, who have normal pulse rates and normal white cell counts are unlikely to have significant pathology requiring further active intervention either medical or surgical.

### Aetiologies and outcomes of patients with abdominal pain presenting to an emergency department of a tertiary hospital in tanzania: a prospective cohort study [^1163jqYx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Abdominal pain is a common complaint amongst adult patients presenting to the EMD-MNH. The most common aetiologies and outcomes are different from HIC, with patients in our setting having higher acuity and higher mortality. Future studies and quality improvement efforts should focus in identifying why such differences exist and how to reduce the mortality.

### Laboratory tests in the patient with abdominal pain [^116BE929]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^114SRLF5]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 4–5% of patients evaluated at an emergency department (ED) present with acute abdominal pain. Some patients that require admission for surgical or medical treatment are easily recognized. Others may present during the early stages of surgical pathology and will be difficult to distinguish from patients with mild self-limiting disease. Judgment errors in evaluating these patients with an ambivalent presentation may lead to therapeutic delay, possibly increasing morbidity and even mortality. For this reason diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) are often used to aid in the diagnostic process and subsequent clinical decision making. Cross-sectional imaging may not, however, be beneficial in the diagnosis of all patients seen in the ED for acute abdominal pain. These examinations are costly, time consuming, and, in the case of CT, subject the patient to ionizing radiation.

Another method often used for the differentiation of mild disease from more serious pathology in ambivalent cases is outpatient re-evaluation. Re-evaluation can allow the disease to present itself through natural progression, permitting surgical cases to become more typical and thus identifiable. In patients with nonspecific abdominal pain or mild nonsurgical diagnoses, the symptoms will regress, allowing the patient to be safely discharged from follow-up.

The present study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of standard outpatient re-evaluation in a large series of patients with acute abdominal pain seen in our ED but who were not considered to require a hospital admission. Our hypothesis is that serial outpatient re-evaluation for patients with equivocal abdominal pain is safe, can improve diagnostic accuracy, and will facilitate proper treatment selection.

### Constipation as cause of acute abdominal pain in children [^111a1z7o]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the causes of acute abdominal pain in a large academic pediatric primary care population.

Study Design

The complete charts of 962 children, ≥ 4 years old, who were seen for at least 1 health maintenance visit during a 6-month period, were reviewed retrospectively for complaints and cause of acute abdominal pain.

Results

We found that 9% of the 962 children had a visit for acute abdominal pain, with significantly more girls (12%) than boys (5%) having this complaint. Acute and chronic constipation were the most frequent causes of acute abdominal pain, occurring in 48% of subjects. A surgical cause was present in 2% of subjects. The cause for the acute abdominal pain remained unknown in 19% of subjects. We did not find significant differences in diagnoses in the primary care clinics versus emergency department.

Conclusions

We found that constipation was the most common cause of acute abdominal pain in children.

INTRODUCTION

Abdominal pain is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom prompting an office-based outpatient or emergency department visit in the United States. Functional GI disorders, now more formally described as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), are the underlying cause of abdominal pain in many patients. IBS is a chronic disorder characterized by recurring abdominal pain associated with disordered bowel habits. According to Rome IV criteria, the diagnosis of IBS requires patients to have abdominal pain ≥ 1 day per week in the previous 3 months. FD is also a pain-predominant disorder. Rome IV diagnostic criteria for FD require patients to present with bothersome epigastric pain (≥ 1 day per week), epigastric burning (≥ 1 day per week), postprandial fullness (≥ 3 days per week), or early satiation (≥ 3 days per week) during the previous 3 months. Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome is characterized by persistent abdominal pain that interferes with daily activities; it is not associated with altered bowel habits.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^114X4gDa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

EGS conditions are a useful measure of test positivity because they are captured in administrative data sets, are concrete diagnoses with clinical significance, typically require intervention, and frequently lead to morbidity or mortality. As new medical and procedural options have evolved, EGS diagnoses no longer exclusively lead to surgery. EGS conditions typically require operative or nonoperative management, which can include antibiotics, analgesia, inpatient medical or surgical management, interventional procedures, and/or surgery. Although we interpreted our test positivity as a CT scan leading to a diagnosis, NHAMCS does not observe the timing at which the diagnosis is made. There are three potential cases for timing. Given the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans for common EGS diagnoses, diagnosis decision making based on CT scans is likely the most common scenario. In some cases, the diagnosis may be strongly suspected based on clinical signs and symptoms, and CT merely confirms a diagnosis. In others, CT could be obtained anticipating negative imaging to rule out a high‐risk diagnosis. This latter use case is unlikely to vary over time, however. There appeared to be a visual increase in EGS diagnoses in the later period. While increased CT and ultrasound utilization seems to account for a substantial portion of this rise, as shown by the individual imaging time trends, an additional potential explanation includes imaging being conducted on those with higher probability of disease. This could come about due to improved clinical targeting of patients at risk of disease or due to selection in the patients presenting to the ED due to their own judgment or due to outpatient provider referrals. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that clinicians are utilizing EGS diagnosis codes more liberally in these observational data based on chart abstraction. Confirmation with prospective cohort studies is needed to differentiate between these potential mechanisms.

Chronic abdominal pain is a common problem seen by pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologist alike. There should not be evidence of underlying organic pathology, with diagnosis based upon the Rome IV criteria. Although it frequently occurs, routine diagnostic testing is not always necessary. Providing assurance and helpful coping strategies is key in the management of chronic abdominal pain. Sometimes other expertise is needed when developing these strategies.

### Abdominal pain in the elderly [^114wGRxk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Elderly patients who have abdominal pain remain one of the most challenging patient populations. Signs and symptoms of serious disease are often nonspecific. Atypical presentations are common in elderly patients. In addition, the higher incidence of serious pathology in this population requires emergency physicians to be vigilant and thorough in their work-up. Vascular catastrophes are more likely to be seen in this population, and a broad differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Increasing frequency of opioid prescriptions for chronic abdominal pain in US outpatient clinics [^115bGsP2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Opioids are sometimes used to treat chronic abdominal pain. However, opioid analgesics have not been proven to be an effective treatment for chronic abdominal pain and have been associated with drug misuse, constipation, and worsening abdominal pain. We sought to estimate the national prescribing trends and factors associated with opioid prescribing for chronic abdominal pain.

Methods

Chronic abdominal pain-related visits by adults to US outpatient clinics were identified using reason-for-visit codes from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1997–2008). Data were weighted to produce national estimates of opioid prescriptions over time. Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for complex survey design, were performed to identify factors associated with opioid use.

Results

The number of outpatient visits for chronic abdominal pain consistently decreased over time from 14.8 million visits (95% confidence interval, 11.6–18.0 visits) in 1997 through 1999 to 12.2 million visits (95% CI, 9.0–15.6 visits) or 1863 visits per 100,000 population in 2006 through 2008 (P for trend = 0.04). Conversely, the adjusted prevalence of visits for which an opioid was prescribed increased from 5.9% (95% CI, 3.5%-8.3%) in 1997 through 1999 to 12.2% (95% CI, 7.5%-17.0%) in 2006 through 2008 (P = 0.03 for trend). Opioid prescriptions were most common among patients aged 25 to 40 years old (odds ratio [OR] 4.6; 95% CI, 1.2–18.4). Opioid prescriptions were less common among uninsured (OR 0.1; 95% CI, 0.04–0.40) and African American (OR 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9) patients.

Conclusions

From 1997 to 2008 opioid prescriptions for chronic abdominal pain more than doubled. Further studies are needed to better understand the reasons for and consequences of this trend.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### A prospective study on the diagnoses for abdominal pain after bariatric surgery: the OPERATE study [^114aDDQj]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global prevalence of obesity is increasing, which impacts the number of bariatric surgeries performed. Bariatric surgery (BS) is currently still the most effective long-term treatment for severe obesity. It has been shown to induce sustainable weight loss and improvement of obesity-related comorbidities, with low complication rates in the first 30 days after surgery. Long-term follow-up, on the other hand, reveals the side effects of BS such as abdominal pain, which leads to numerous hospital visits, readmissions, and reoperations.

The self-reported prevalence of abdominal pain after BS varies between 33.8 and 54.4%. Abdominal pain has a negative impact on quality of life and imposes a burden on public healthcare costs. Establishing a diagnosis for abdominal pain after BS often requires several tests, including blood tests, ultrasounds, CT-scans, gastroscopies, and diagnostic laparoscopies. Common causes are internal herniation, an anastomotic ulcer, and gallstone disease. However, often abdominal pain remains unexplained because a diagnosis cannot be made.

Literature on the diagnoses of abdominal pain during outpatient clinic and emergency department visits among patients after BS is limited. Crucially, follow-up of the abdominal pain after first visits is lacking, as is insight into the magnitude of the group with unexplained complaints at the end of the follow-up. The aim of this study is to provide the first overview of the diagnoses of abdominal pain in patients after BS and the percentage of unexplained complaints at initial presentation and after follow-up. In addition, number and yield of follow-up visits and the time between first visit and the diagnosis are examined. Finally, it is examined whether the complaints were resolved or persisted at the end of follow-up.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^114ZtX1R]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Managing acute pain in individuals with preexisting chronic pain — prevalence and opioid avoidance for common syndromes are outlined: Frequent headaches occur in up to 15% of adolescents, and functional abdominal pain occurs in 13.5% of children and adolescents. Some chronic conditions that PHCPs commonly encounter (eg, headache, migraine, abdominal pain) should generally not be treated with opioids; in these cases, opioid treatment might mask a more serious underlying diagnosis, and nonopioid medications are often more effective at providing symptomatic relief, and hence, in general, these pain syndromes should not be treated with opioids.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in the evaluation and management of pain in the outpatient setting, 2006–2015 [^111dfft9]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Much is known about racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of opioids for pain in emergency departments. Less is known about such disparities in the evaluation and management of pain in the outpatient setting.

Methods

Using the nationally representative National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), we estimated disparities in visit time with physicians and opioid receipt in the outpatient setting. We focused on patients whose reason for visiting was abdominal pain or back pain. Our sample included 4,764 white patients, 692 black patients, and 682 Hispanic patients.

Results

Back pain visits of Hispanic patients lasted 1.6 fewer minutes than those of white non-Hispanic patients (P = 0.04 for the difference). Black patients were 6.0% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for abdominal pain (P = 0.04 for the difference) and 7.1% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for back pain (P = 0.046 for the difference). Hispanic patients were 6.3% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for abdominal pain (P = 0.003 for the difference) and 14.8% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for back pain (P < 0.001 for the difference). Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to receive nonopioids instead of opioids for both abdominal pain and back pain. Differences in opioid receipt did not narrow during the examined time period.

Conclusions

Identifying causes of racial and ethnic disparities in the evaluation and treatment of pain in the outpatient setting is important to improving the health and function of patients.

### Abdominal pain in children [^1178cnkf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons pediatric patients seek emergency care. The emergency physician must be able to distinguish diagnoses requiring immediate attention from self-limiting processes. Pediatric patients can be challenging, particularly those who are preverbal, and therefore, the clinician must rely on a detailed history from a parent or caregiver as well as a careful physical examination in order to narrow the differential diagnosis. This article highlights several pediatric diagnoses presenting as abdominal pain, including surgical emergencies, nonsurgical diagnoses, and extraabdominal processes, and reviews the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of each.

### Management of patients with chronic abdominal pain in clinical practice [^115L9xUj]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2006). Low credibility.

A practical approach to the management of chronic abdominal pain is needed, given the high prevalence and impact of this problem. This article describes an approach that has evolved based on clinical experience and review of the literature: identifying predominant bloaters and abdominal wall pain; exclusion of organic disease, including consideration of laparoscopy for diagnosis; consideration of chronic functional abdominal pain and the first and second line pharmacotherapies; and seeking specialist care in a pain clinic, psychiatry, or behavioural therapy.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1166LKz4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

### Lower abdominal pain [^115UKSfw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although most frequently presenting with lower abdominal pain, appendicitis, colitis, and diverticulitis can cause pain throughout the abdomen and can cause peritoneal and retroperitoneal symptoms. Evaluation and management of lower intestinal disease requires a nuanced approach by the emergency physician, sometimes requiring computed tomography, ultrasonography, MRI, layered imaging, shared decision making, serial examination, and/or close follow-up. Once a presumed or confirmed diagnosis is made, appropriate treatment is initiated, and may include surgery, antibiotics, and/or steroids. Appendicitis patients should be admitted. Diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease can frequently be managed on an outpatient basis, but may require admission and surgical consultation.

### High rate of emergency department care in youth with abdominal pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders [^115JYLMQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective was to describe patterns of care delivery locations in youth with abdominal pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGID) and assess for differences in patterns of care delivery by sex and race. A secondary objective was to describe cost variability within the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Data were obtained using a large, single-vendor database that extracts and deidentifies data from the electronic health record across the outpatient, ED, and inpatient continuum of care. We evaluated patients 8 to 17 years of age seen over an 8-year period for a priority 1 diagnosis of an AP-FGID. Data collected included age, sex, race, encounter location, and total cost of ED encounters. We specifically assessed how often patients seen in the ED were also seen in outpatient or inpatient settings.

Results

A total of 53,750 patients (64% female; mean age, 13.3 ± 2.8 years) were identified and assessed. The most common location of care was the ED (48.8%) followed by the outpatient setting (46.2%). Of patients seen for a priority 1 AP-FGID diagnosis in the ED, only 3.7% were seen for a priority 1 diagnosis in the outpatient setting, and only 1% were seen in an inpatient setting. Overall, females received 42.5% of their care and males received 44.8% of their care in the ED. The overall rate of ED care was 66.9% for Hispanic, 61.5% for African American, 55.1% for Asian, 46.6% for Native American, and 36.9% for Caucasian patients.

Conclusions

The ED is the most common location for care for youth with AP-FGIDs and, for the majority, seems to be the only location. This seems to be particularly true for Hispanic and African American patients. Given the often complex psychosocial needs of this patient group, processes need to be developed to transition these patients into the outpatient setting, ideally to programs specializing in chronic pain.

### Pediatric abdominal pain: an emergency medicine perspective [^113Kk622]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint that leads to pediatric patients seeking emergency care.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^111yv57r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^111aKNLq]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Laparoscopy can also accurately distinguish patients that require surgery from those that can be treated conservatively, and it has been proposed as routine management for patients with acute abdominal pain for whom the decision to operate is uncertain. Nevertheless, laparoscopy in itself is an operation, and can be regarded as too invasive as a first-line diagnostic measure when similar accuracy can be achieved without an operation.

Hospital admission for patients with equivocal abdominal complaints has been a common practice for many years. The effectiveness of this practice is limited because most patients ultimately have NSAP for which an admission to hospital is in fact not required. In recent years the percentage of hospital admissions for patients with acute abdominal pain has decreased, possibly as a result of advances in diagnostic technology and improved ED faculty presence.

Another method often used to help distinguish surgical pathology from mild self-limiting disease in patients with equivocal abdominal pain is outpatient re-evaluation. Patients with abdominal pathology requiring surgery who initially present during the early stages of the disease will become more easily identifiable, whereas the symptoms will regress in those patients with self limiting disease allowing them to be safely discharged from follow-up.

GRACE-2 low-risk recurrent abdominal pain — values, preferences, and application emphasize that shared decision making with individual patients is necessary to target treatment plans to the priorities of the patient at hand; given the lack of any direct evidence to support the GRACE-2 recommendations, patient and physician preferences should be strongly considered; and the guideline should also be applied in the context of local policies and resources, such as the availability of CT, ultrasound, hospital capacity, outpatient follow-up services, and mental health resources.

### Postpartum visits in the gynecological emergency room: how can we improve? [^111FqkDD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Fever, abdominal pain, problems in episiotomy or surgical scar, and vaginal bleeding were the most common causes of the GER visits found in the present study. Postpartum women following cesarean sections and women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are at increased risk of comorbidities in the postpartum period. We recommend meticulous explanations to the women both in the hospital before discharge and in the outpatient clinics regarding the postpartum care in both vaginal and cesarean deliveries. Special emphasis should be made on the adherence to medical treatment received at home, in order to avoid physical deterioration. Scheduled visits to high-risk women to attend outpatient clinic sooner are recommended.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^1168Trqx]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Outpatient re-evaluation for patients with equivocal abdominal complaints has not been reported extensively in the literature. Only one study comparing outpatient follow-up to active clinical observation for patients with NSAP in the ED concluded that outpatient evaluation seems to be a safe option that is not accompanied by an increased incidence of complications. The present study is the first to report the value of standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients that are presumed not to require a hospital admission after evaluation at the ED for acute abdominal complaints. After standard re-evaluation 30% of the patients had a different final diagnosis than the diagnosis initially given after evaluation at the ED. A change in management was seen in 17% of the cases after re-evaluation, and 4% of the patients were later admitted to hospital for surgery. These are important changes from the patient's point of view, demonstrating that standard outpatient re-evaluation is a valuable method that improves diagnostic accuracy and helps to select the proper management strategies in this patient population. The initial management decisions made by the evaluating physician at the ED regarding whether patients should receive additional imaging or be admitted to the hospital were not scrutinized in this study. The study was designed to mimic daily practice, and allowed for these management decisions to be made just as they are in daily routine where basic clinical judgment plays a fundamental role. Apparently these clinical assessments are precise enough to triage accurately without detrimental effects for the patient. Only 6 patients (1.2%) had diagnoses that should preferably have been made at initial evaluation. This however did not lead to increased morbidity.

### Derivation and identification of questions that act as predictors of abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin [^1126sLNk]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Although most causes of abdominal pain have a visceral origin, the musculoskeletal system must be considered when the cause is not obvious. This prospective study aimed to identify questions that would aid the diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin.

Design

Assessment of consecutive patients with abdominal pain recruited from gastroenterological outpatient clinics to develop diagnostic pointers to identify abdominal pain arising from musculoskeletal disorders.

Participants

Subjects with benign abdominal pain, with or without a change in bowel habit, were recruited from gastroenterological clinics. Patients with inflammatory or neoplastic disease were excluded.

Setting

The study was conducted in the Physiotherapy Department, Addenbrooke's NHS Trust Hospital, Cambridge.

Main Outcome Measures

A set of questions developed to indicate a musculoskeletal cause of a patient's abdominal symptoms. RESULTS The questions 'Does taking a deep breath aggravate your symptoms?' and 'Does twisting your back aggravate your symptoms?' had a significant positive indication of abdominal symptoms of musculoskeletal origin. The questions 'Has there been any change in bowel habit since onset of your symptoms?', 'Does eating foods aggravate your symptoms?' and 'Has there been any weight change since onset of symptoms?' had a significant negative indication for abdominal symptoms not of musculoskeletal origin. A combination of these questions gave 96% specificity and 67% sensitivity.

Conclusion

These questions may help with the early identification of patients with abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin and will be tested in further studies.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^116cenKo]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

For a diagnostic study to have impact in clinical practice, the results should be obtained in a representative population and setting. This multicentre study closely mimicked daily practice; a large number of residents and radiological observers, with varying levels of experience, participated. The multicentre setting included university and teaching hospitals. We believe that our results reflect the performance of imaging strategies in daily practice and are relevant to physicians managing patients with acute abdominal pain.

The use of imaging has been widely investigated for the two most common causes of acute abdominal pain — acute appendicitis and diverticulitis. In patients with suspected diverticulitis, imaging is helpful in detecting complications of diverticulitis to assist in therapeutic decisions. For suspected acute appendicitis, extensive use of CT has been shown to reduce rates of negative appendicectomy and lower overall hospital costs by preventing unnecessary admissions and surgical explorations. Although imaging in general showed a positive effect on patients' outcomes in acute appendicitis, the ideal diagnostic strategy for acute appendicitis remains a matter of debate, as imaging might not be necessary for certain presentations.

In unselected patients with acute abdominal pain, studies have shown that the use of diagnostic imaging positively affects the clinical diagnosis and influences decisions on management. Diagnostic laparoscopy has also been shown to be an accurate investigation in patients with acute abdominal pain. However, an invasive procedure can often be prevented with an accurate imaging strategy, as imaging reduced false positive clinical diagnoses. Considering the costs and invasiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy in comparison with imaging, this investigation should probably be reserved for clinically ill patients with non-diagnostic imaging or for therapeutic indications.

The lifetime risk of radiation induced fatal cancer is age dependent. The dose of radiation associated with abdominal CT in an acute abdomen is approximately 10 mSv. For a 25 year old patient, the estimated risk of induction of cancer for such a CT examination is about 1 in 900. The estimated risk of induction of fatal cancer is about 1 in 1800. For a 50 year old, the equivalent risks are 1 in 1500 and 1 in 2500. In general, consensus exists that the information obtained with diagnostic CT outweighs the risk associated with radiation and that the risk of induction of cancer should be seen in the light of the lifetime risk of cancer. In the future, magnetic resonance imaging may be valuable for making a diagnosis in acute abdominal pain. Until now, the availability of magnetic resonance imaging at the emergency department has been low and this investigation is mainly reserved for patients with a contraindication to CT, such as pregnant patients.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^111rzpkW]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Ultrasound will only be an acceptable alternative for CT if its diagnostic accuracy is comparable, i.e. if it can be reliably used for the detection of frequent causes of abdominal pain in unselected patients presenting at the ED. In this paper we report a head-to-head comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and CT in detecting common causes of acute abdominal pain, such as appendicitis and diverticulitis, in patients presenting at the ED with acute abdominal pain. We also evaluated to what extent the accuracy of ultrasound was affected by patient characteristics and observer experience.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111svvmD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Unlike CT, hepatobiliary ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation. It represents a potentially effective diagnostic modality for upper abdominal pain or other symptoms suggesting a hepatobiliary origin. In contrast to either modality, abdominal X‐rays are poorly sensitive and poorly specific for clinically significant disease and are potentially misleading.

Prior literature has demonstrated that utilization of imaging modalities increased as they have become more available. The rate of abdominal CT scans for all indications increased 17.5‐fold from 1990 to 2009. Additionally, abdominal pain grew to become the leading chief complaint among those who underwent a CT scan in United States EDs from 1995 to 2007. The probability of obtaining a specific diagnosis via CT scan increases with age, yet for older adults with abdominal pain, nearly one in six ED visitshas been shown to receive an X‐ray without ultrasound or CT, a potentially ineffective test in older adults, and this occurs more often for older women. Little evidence is available from the past decade to understand whether the rapid initial growthof these modalities used to assess abdominal pain has continued, whether changes in utilization are differential across age groups, and whether increased imaging rates have resulted in greater rates of clinically significant diagnoses.

We hypothesized prior to data collection that a continuous increase in CT and ultrasound imaging modalities and a decrease in X‐ray use occurred from 2007 to 2019. To test these hypotheses, we used nationally representative ED data to describe trends in ED visits for abdominal pain chief complaints from 2007 to 2019, including the growth of abdominal pain visits, the rate of imaging for different modalities, and the diagnoses received. We analyze these trends across three subgroups of age (young adult, middle age, and older adult) who differ in their typical physiology, comorbidities, symptoms, and etiologies of their abdominal pain.

### Association between advanced image ordered in the emergency department on subsequent imaging for abdominal pain patients [^111shNw4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Primary physicians increasingly refer patients to the ED for acute issues as opposed to scheduling office visits; ED physicians are now responsible for 28% of all acute care visits. Abdominal pain prompts more ED visits than any other chief complaint, representing 8.8% of visits in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, responsible for over 12 million annual ED visits, and the number of visits for abdominal pain is growing both absolutely and proportionally to other chief complaints. Given the broad differential diagnosis for these patients, they are subject to complex evaluations including advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. These visits are associated with high rates of ED imaging compared to other complaints with rates ranging from 25% to more than 40%and high rates of return visits.

ED visits and imaging are commonly viewed as inefficient or overutilized, with policymakers and the press focusing on reducing "unnecessary" ED visits or imaging studies. Additionally, return visits to the ED are being scrutinized as a measure of lower quality and more costly care. A better understanding is needed to fully characterize the effects of imaging decisions made in the ED. We examined associations between advanced imaging (i.e. CT, MRI, and ultrasound) and subsequent care trajectories and resource utilization. We hypothesized that advanced imaging in the ED is associated with decreased rates of subsequent imaging in outpatient settings and ED revisits for patients with abdominal pain that are discharged from the ED.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### Inefficient admissions for abdominal pain under an acute general surgical unit [^113vG8hM]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain control can be a significant component to early discharge for patients with non-specific abdominal pain. As emphasised by the findings in Fig. 3, length of stay was inversely correlated with pain control regardless of diagnosis. The majority of acute abdominal pain referrals in the outpatient setting are settled with analgesia, reassurance and appropriate follow-up. A focus on effective analgesic regimes in the GP or emergency department setting may prevent AGSU admissions for ongoing abdominal pain without a surgical cause in addition to reducing hospital length of stay for all patients.

Between 40 and 75% of GP abdominal pain referrals have been found to be appropriate to discharge from ED or treat in the general practice setting, and suggest the possibility of defensive medicine with patients referred based on an unclear diagnosis as opposed to a clear surgical indication. This is also reflected in the data from this study, with those patients with a CRP < 50 and confirmed diagnosis on imaging having the shortest length of stay, suggesting a fear of discharging patients without a diagnosis. However, a limitation of this study in making these comparisons is that only patients who were admitted under AGSU were assessed, with an unknown number of non-specific abdominal pain patients being successfully treated by ED without AGSU admission. Evidently from this study's data, most admitted patients are discharged from hospital without a clear diagnosis in any case. A dedicated pathway for these patients would help alleviate the fear of discharging a patient without a known pathology.

### Improving the surgical hot clinic [^112EjHP5]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency surgery for conditions such as peritonitis, obstruction, and other abdominal catastrophes is a high risk and high costly area of surgical practice requiring in-patient management. There are a wide variety of other conditions managed by the acute surgical team that are less acute but classically result in an expensive inpatient stay, usually for diagnostic tests and which often do not result in definitive in-patient management. Examples of these conditions are cholecystitis, biliary colic, mild uncomplicated diverticulitis, and non-specific abdominal pain. Royal college of Surgeons of England guidelines outlines how these conditions may be safely managed in an ambulatory setting, reducing costs to the healthcare provider and the inpatient burden to the acute surgical team. Valuable time can therefore be released for the assessment and management of acutely unwell patients requiring in-patient management. Ambulatory care is well developed in medicine, with most departments in the United Kingdom offering a service for a range of medical conditions. However, this service is much less developed in the surgical setting, with a limited evidence base.

This premise was explored and reported on recently, with new guidelines being drafted by the Royal College of Surgeons commissioning guide: emergency general surgery (acute abdominal pain). The guidelines focus on a number of areas, but this QIP focuses on section 1.3, Emergency surgery ambulatory care (ESAC) pathway. The RCS predicts that up to 30% of patients on an acute general surgical take could be managed using this pathway and thus avoid hospital admission.

Underpinning the expansion and improvement of the ambulatory service is risk management. Patients with acute abdominal pain have a variety of differential diagnosis ranging from the benign to the immediately life threatening. Therefore a patient must be adequately assessed with appropriate senior input, and if managed as an outpatient, communication with the patient's primary care provider (GP) is essential for continuity of care and to ensure patient satisfaction.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112fTbZk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Patients with undiagnosed HAE with GI symptoms are likely to present across many care settings, including both primary care and specialist clinics. Inclusion of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained severe and often recurrent abdominal pain, with or without skin manifestations, may improve the diagnosis rate of HAE. Careful history-taking and a physical examination along with selected imaging studies and laboratory testing are vital to making the diagnosis. By including HAE in the differential diagnosis, providers can make the appropriate referral to a physician experienced in managing HAE, thus shortening the time to diagnosis and effective treatment and reducing the burden of disease.

### Burden of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorder in an emergency department – A single-center experience [^1164Q53S]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are recurrent or chronic gastrointestinal signs and symptoms in the absence of anatomical or biochemical alterations. They are commonly treated in outpatient setting but often present to emergency departments. We aimed to estimate the burden of pediatric FGID on a busy accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Methods

Electronic patient records were used to retrospectively analyze the A&E attendances of 3866 patients presenting with either constipation or abdominal pain. Those found not to have a surgical/organic cause were assessed in terms of various parameters, that is, arrival times, wait times, and investigations performed.

Results

A total of 91.31% of the attendances relating to constipation or nonsurgical, nonorganic causes of abdominal pain were self-referred with only 3.64% arriving via ambulance, an average wait time ranging between 138 and 156 minutes, and a total of 1008 investigations carried out on patients presenting with these symptoms. A total of 63.65% of the patients were discharged without follow-up.

Conclusions

Functional gastrointestinal disorders place considerable burden on the A&E, in terms of resource usage, time of clinicians, and financial strain. More education should be provided to families of those experiencing FGID in an outpatient setting to minimize A&E resource utilization. More research is needed to ascertain the true burden of FGIDs, both financially and in terms of time and resource.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^116dSrMQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 recurrent abdominal pain — definition for emergency department (ED) patients: Recurrent is defined as two or more prior similar episodes within a period of 12 months, with the time elapsed from the first episode to the current episode being greater than or equal to 30 days. For comparison, the criteria for recurrent abdominal pain established by Rome IV for irritable bowel syndrome require abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per week in the past 3 months, with symptoms beginning at least 6 months prior to diagnosis, and recurrence was not intended to address repeated short-term presentations with an acute and evolving new abdominal syndrome.

### Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^115htQ4u]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder seen in gastroenterology practice. It is also a large component of primary care practices. Although the classic IBS symptoms of lower abdominal pain, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits is easily recognizable to most physicians, diagnosing IBS remains a challenge. This is in part caused by the absence of anatomic or physiologic markers. For this reason, the diagnosis of IBS currently needs to be made on clinical grounds. A number of symptom-based diagnostic criteria have been proposed over the last 15 years. The most recent of these, the Rome II criteria, seem to show reasonable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing IBS. However, the role of the Rome II criteria in clinical practice remains ill defined. A review of the literature shows that, in patients with no alarm symptoms, the Rome criteria have a positive predictive value of approximately 98%, and that additional diagnostic tests have a yield of 2% or less. Diagnostic evaluation should also include a psychosocial assessment specifically addressing any history of sexual or physical abuse because these issues significantly influence management strategies and treatment success.

### Abdominal pain in special populations [^115JAmDF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation and management of acute abdominal pain in special populations can be challenging for the emergency physician. This article focuses on two specific populations: patients with altered immunologic function and postprocedural patients. Recognition of life-threatening abdominal diseases may be delayed in immunosuppressed patients because of the atypical presentations of these conditions. In postprocedural patients, evaluation of acute abdominal symptoms requires an understanding of the complications of procedures often performed by others. The unique characteristics of abdominal pain in these two populations and, more specifically, which diseases to consider and how to use appropriate testing to detect life-threatening conditions, are discussed.

### Functional abdominal pain and related syndromes [^113e48sL]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are very common. They result from dysfunctional interaction in the brain-gut axis. Although the nature is benign, symptoms may be debilitating. The etiology is multifactorial; therefore, the diagnosis should be approached in a bio-psychosocial model. There are no biomarkers to characterize these conditions, but a solid understanding of the pathophysiology allows providers to present these disorders as a positive clinical diagnosis, rather than a diagnosis of exclusion. Effective management entails close collaboration between the medical and mental health providers.

### AGA institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19 [^114Bfn18]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^113jvDyY]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), approximately 10% have complaints of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. Formerly these patients were thought to have a acute abdomen, and surgery was indicated. Nowadays, patients with acute abdominal pain, even if accompanied by abdominal tenderness and rigidity, not all of them will undergo surgery, while others without abdominal rigidity are operated on. Diagnostic imaging is widely used in the work-up of patients with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are both frequently used on top of clinical and laboratory evaluation. The American College of Radiology suggests an abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast medium in patients with acute abdominal pain. Others are in favour of ultrasound as the primary imaging technique mainly because ultrasound is easily accessible and does not expose patients to ionising radiation. Ionising radiation exposure at CT is associated with the risk of radiation-induced cancer. This is a drawback of CT, especially as CT is increasingly being used in the diagnostic work-up of young patients. This may prompt the evaluation of alternative imaging strategies next to CT, such as ultrasound and MRI. However, diagnoses should not be missed or delayed and thus the most accurate imaging technique should be used.

A previous evaluation of diagnostic strategies for unselected patients with acute abdominal pain favoured a conditional CT strategy for the detection of urgent conditions, with ultrasound first and CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasound. For common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain, such as appendicitis literature suggests CT in the diagnostic work-up of these patients suspected with appendicitis. Primarily usage of CT in patients suspected with diverticulitis is not supported by literature, as accuracy of US and CT were comparable in a recent published meta-analysis. The fact that ultrasound is observer-dependent is thought to be a major disadvantage. Its accuracy, as reported in the literature, may be overestimated because in a research environment ultrasound is usually performed by highly experienced observers. Ultrasound accuracy could also be lower in specific patient subgroups, such as in obese patients, women, and in specific age groups, especially women of reproductive age. CT, on the other hand has good inter-observer agreement in general, and even excellent inter-observer agreement for frequent diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain (e.g. appendicitis and diverticulitis).

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^115DtNZj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 — depression/anxiety screening in adults with recurrent or undifferentiated abdominal pain in the emergency department notes limited evidence and cautious implementation. The guideline states "We found no evidence on the potential benefits or harms of anxiety screening" and that "Screening alone is unlikely to have a large desirable effect". It emphasizes that "the presence of depression and/or anxiety does not exclude a coexisting serious cause of abdominal pain, and physicians should not use mental health screening as a method to determine the need for further evaluation of abdominal pain". It adds that "It is uncertain whether ED screening of patients with recurrent and undifferentiated abdominal pain would meaningfully improve patient-oriented outcomes", and "we proposed that screening should not occur as part of the triage process but later in the ED evaluation, preferably after other priority workup has been completed and life-threatening causes of abdominal pain have been ruled out". Contextually, "Both depression and anxiety appear to be relatively common in our population of interest despite the indirectness and uncertainty of evidence", and "We emphasized that the coexistence of depression and abdominal pain does not prove a causal relationship… We felt it important to acknowledge these possibilities with patients".

### AGA clinical practice update on pain management in inflammatory bowel disease: commentary [^113jehkM]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on pain in inflammatory bowel disease — prevalence and persistence of abdominal pain are emphasized: Between 60% and 75% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease report pain. IBD providers are much less equipped to manage the 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis and 60% of patients with Crohn's disease who experience persistent abdominal pain symptoms when endoscopic findings indicate that the underlying IBD is "in remission". Persistent or chronic abdominal pain is associated increasingly with higher unplanned health care use, disability, and mental health decline, and management is complicated by strong recommendations to avoid narcotic medications. Pain also commonly occurs when intestinal inflammation is quiescent, leaving many gastroenterologists at a loss when pain presents without gut inflammation.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^113qPkH9]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients who are not admitted to the hospital after emergency department surgical consultation for acute abdominal pain.

Methods

All patients seen at the emergency department between June 2005 and July 2006 for acute abdominal pain were included in a prospective study using a structured diagnosis and management flowchart. Patients not admitted to the hospital were given appointments for re-evaluation at the outpatient clinic within 24 h. All clinical parameters, radiological results, diagnostic considerations, and management proposals were scored prospectively.

Results

Five-hundred patients were included in this analysis. For 148 patients (30%), the final diagnosis was different from the diagnosis after initial evaluation. Eighty-five patients (17%) had a change in management after re-evaluation, and 20 of them (4%) were admitted to the hospital for an operation. Only 6 patients (1.2%) had a delay in diagnosis and treatment, which did not cause extra morbidity.

Conclusions

Standard outpatient re-evaluation is a safe and effective means of improving diagnostic accuracy and helps to adapt management for patients that are not admitted to the hospital after surgical consultation for acute abdominal pain at the emergency department.

### Effectiveness of standardized pain management protocols for acute abdominal pain in emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yFcM7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain constitutes a substantial proportion of emergency department (ED) presentations, yet pain management remains suboptimal due to historical concerns about masking diagnoses. This systematic review comprehensively evaluates standardized pain management protocols across diverse abdominal pathologies.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of standardized pain management protocols compared to usual care in reducing time to analgesia and improving pain relief outcomes for adults presenting to EDs with acute abdominal pain of visceral, biliary, renal, or pelvic origin.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from January 1, 2000, to January 31, 2025. Eligible studies included adults (≥ 18 years) with acute abdominal pain in ED settings, comparing standardized protocols (nurse-initiated, clinical pathways, patient-controlled analgesia, multimodal approaches) to usual care. Primary outcome was time to first analgesia. Secondary outcomes encompassed pain reduction, patient satisfaction, guideline adherence, and diagnostic accuracy. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane ROB-2 for randomized controlled trials and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted with comprehensive sensitivity analyses.

Results

From 621 identified records, 47 studies (n = 8347 patients) met inclusion criteria. Time to analgesia meta-analysis (15 studies, n = 3241) demonstrated substantial reduction with standardized protocols: pooled effect size d = 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41–0.67), representing 42.7% reduction (37.3 minutes absolute). Pain intensity reduction (18 studies, n = 3892) showed significant improvement: standardized mean differences (SMD) -0.76 (95% CI: -0.89 to -0.63). Patient satisfaction improved consistently (12 studies, risk ratios [RR] 1.43, 95% CI: 1.28–1.59). Diagnostic accuracy remained unaffected (8 studies, RR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94–1.02). Subgroup analyses confirmed benefits across all pathologies, including biliary and pelvic conditions specifically.

Conclusions

Standardized pain management protocols demonstrate robust effectiveness in reducing time to analgesia and improving pain relief across all acute abdominal pathologies without compromising diagnostic accuracy. These findings definitively refute historical concerns and support immediate implementation in emergency departments globally.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^116Gd4cm]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric functional abdominal pain — prevalence and burden are highlighted: chronic abdominal pain occurs in 2% to 4% of all pediatric office visits, and 13% of middle school–age and 17% of high school–age students experience abdominal pain weekly; the chronic nature of abdominal pain has a negative impact on the quality of life for these children.

### Nontraumatic abdominal emergencies: acute abdominal pain: diagnostic strategies [^113V1JGd]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Common causes of acute abdominal pain include appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, urinary colic, perforated peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, and nonspecific, nonsurgical abdominal pain. The topographic classification of acute abdominal pain (pain in one of the four abdominal quadrants, diffuse abdominal pain, flank or epigastric pain) facilitates the choice of the imaging technique. The initial radiological evaluation often consists of plain abdominal radiography, despite significant diagnostic limitations. The traditional indications for plain films — bowel obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, and the search of ureteral calculi — are questioned by helical computed tomography (CT). Although ultrasonography (US) is in many centers the modality of choice for imaging the gallbladder and the pelvis in children and women of reproductive age, CT is considered to be one of the most valued tools for triaging patients with acute abdominal pain. CT is particularly beneficial in patients with marked obesity, unclear US findings, bowel obstruction, and multiple lesions. The introduction of multidetector row CT (MDCT) has further enhanced the utility of CT in imaging patients with acute abdominal pain.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113z6sUS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Whether outcomes for abdominal pain patients have changed with additional imaging requires additional study using data sets other than NHAMCS, which does not record outcomes after the ED visit and any subsequent hospitalization. For pulmonary embolisms, increased use of CT angiography yielded additional diagnoses but those diagnoses were less severe and of unclear clinical significance. The impact of additional diagnoses on population health depends on the natural history of untreated compared to treated disease. For instance, patients with small gallstones diagnosed by CT or ultrasound might be overintervened upon once diagnosed, perpetuating overutilization of health care, whereas early appendicitis diagnoses allow for successful antibiotic treatment or laparoscopic surgery before a perforation can occur.

The distribution of diagnoses categories within EGS condition varied across age groups. Appendicitis was a top 10 diagnosis for all age groups, contrary to clinical guidelines that suggest it is more prevalent at younger ages, although in absolute terms it remains more common at younger ages. Colitis was in the top 10 diagnoses for younger adults but not for older ages; these acute colitis diagnoses may represent overdiagnosis, where viral or other benign infectious or inflammatory causes of colitis are being uncovered by CT, resulting in potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescription. Biliary disease, primarily calculi, and cholecystitis were prevalent in all ages, but ultrasound — a methodology well suited to these diagnoses — was used approximately twice as much in younger compared to older adults. This may reflect a clinical suspicion of alternative diagnoses, greater diagnostic complexity, or less confidence in physical examination for the older adult abdomen. Diverticular disease, classically a disease of middle‐aged and older adults, was more common in these age groups but still present in younger adults, which may reflect poor diet in this U.S.‐based study. Visits for bowel obstruction and ileus became more common with increased age, consistent with the accumulation of scar tissue from prior surgery and increased malignancy risk with age. Pancreatitis was modestly more prevalent in middle‐aged adults but remained a top 10 diagnosis in all age groups. Consistent with the hypothesis that older adults have greater diagnostic complexity, the proportion of EGS diagnoses outside the top 10 for older adults was found to be larger than for the younger ages, showing that older adults have a wider variety of potential common diagnoses compared to their younger counterparts. It is important to note that although there is an increase in CT scans, the top 10 EGS diagnoses for patients with abdominal pain only account for approximately 15% of all patients who have abdominal pain in the middle and older age groups and a little over 10% of younger adults.

### Functional abdominal pain: what clinicians need to know [^115TY4QT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain in childhood is extremely common and presents frequently to both primary and secondary care, with many children having recurrent pain which impacts on daily functioning. Despite this most children have no discernible underlying pathology. We discuss the underlying mechanism for functional abdominal pain (visceral hypersensitivity), the evidence base linking parental anxiety and patient symptoms, and how parents can be supported in managing their children's symptoms by addressing questions commonly asked by children and families. We look at the evidence for a one-stop rational approach to investigation including a coeliac screen, inflammatory markers and consideration of stool faecal calprotectin, in the absence of red flags. We evaluate commonly used treatments for functional abdominal pain, within a context of managing family expectations. Given the limitations in pharmacological treatment options, trials of probiotics, peppermint oil, mebeverine and (for short-term use only) hyoscine butylbromide may be appropriate. Psychological interventions including cognitive-behavioural therapy, distraction techniques and hypnotherapy have a better evidence base. There is also some evidence for other complementary therapies in children, including yoga and neurostimulation. Outcome is generally good providing there is child and family acceptance of the multiple factors implicated in the aetiology of the pain.

### Childhood functional abdominal pain: mechanisms and management [^1168bqHP]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain is one of the most common clinical syndromes encountered in day to day clinical paediatric practice. Although common, its definition is confusing, predisposing factors are poorly understood and the pathophysiological mechanisms are not clear. The prevailing viewpoint in the pathogenesis involves the inter-relationship between changes in hypersensitivity and altered motility, to which several risk factors have been linked. Making a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain can be a challenge, as it is unclear which further diagnostic tests are necessary to exclude an organic cause. Moreover, large, well-performed, high-quality clinical trials for effective agents are lacking, which undermines evidence-based treatment. This Review summarizes current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors and diagnostic work-up of functional abdominal pain. Finally, management options for children with functional abdominal pain are discussed including medications, dietary interventions, probiotics and psychological and complementary therapies, to improve understanding and to maximize the quality of care for children with this condition.

Consultative management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) gastrointestinal (GI) and liver issues — best practice statements are as follows: In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity. There is presently inadequate evidence to support stool testing for diagnosis or monitoring of COVID-19 as part of routine clinical practice. In patients (outpatients or inpatients) with elevated LFTs in context of suspected or known COVID-19, evaluate for alternative etiologies. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain baseline LFTs at the time of admission and consider LFT monitoring throughout the hospitalization, particularly in the context of drug treatment for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients undergoing drug treatment for COVID-19, evaluate for treatment-related GI and hepatic adverse effects.

### Medically unexplained symptoms in frequent attenders of secondary health care: retrospective cohort study [^116skq2X]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of medically unexplained symptoms in patients who most frequently attend outpatient services.

Design

Retrospective cohort study over three years with review of case notes.

Setting

Secondary care services in the South Thames (West) NHS region.

Participants

Outpatient attenders with new appointments in 1993.

Main Outcome Measures

Number of outpatient appointments, and number of consultation episodes for medically unexplained conditions.

Results

Medical records of 361 of 400 sampled frequent attenders were examined, and 971 consultation episodes were recorded. Ninety seven (27%) had one or more consultation episodes in which the condition was medically unexplained; 208 (21%) of the 971 consultation episodes were medically unexplained. Abdominal pain, chest pain, headache, and back pain were commonly found to be medically unexplained.

Conclusions

Medically unexplained symptoms present in most hospital specialties and account for a considerable proportion of consultations by frequent attenders in secondary care.

### Lead poisoning; a neglected potential diagnosis in abdominal pain [^111kmqKZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is one of the leading reasons for seeking medical care in emergency and outpatient departments. Abdominal pain has a diverse diagnostic schema, which ranges from mild self-limiting conditions to life-threatening emergencies. It is believed 20–40% of abdominal pain etiologies remain unknown at the time of discharge. Lead toxicity is on the differential diagnosis for abdominal pain, albiet more often of a chronic nature. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that blood lead levels (BLLs) of greater than 5 mg/dL are elevated.

During the difficult time of an endemic or epidemic, premature closure of a diagnosis is exacerbated by anchoring, the tendency for clinicians to stick with the initial impression even as new information becomes available. Because of the broad differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, misdiagnosis may be minimized by a formalized approach. Anchoring is exacerbated during times such as the opium endemic in Iran. In order to avoid this diagnostic misadventure, clinicians must keep an open mind as to the diagnosis and use the iterative process of the differential diagnosis. By following a predetermined algorithm, diagnostic errors can be minimized.

Lead poisoning may occur from many situations, including occupational exposure (e.g. battery manufacturing workers, lead solder workers, automobile radiator repair, etc.), tile workers, and potters or paint chips. Lead-based paints before 1950, old pipes, house dusts, imported toys, and herbal and Ayurvedic medications are among the possible sources for lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is generally asymptomatic; however, it can present with abdominal pain, constipation, anemia, hearing loss, fatigue, neuropathy and neurotoxicity, encephalopathy, renal diseases, abortions, osteopenia, and even death.

Treatment of lead poisoning is centered on prevention, eliminating lead exposure, proper diet (rich in calcium and iron), education, and if indicated, treatment using chelating agents including (dimercaprol (BAL), calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2 EDTA), succimer (DMSA,2–3 mesodimercaptosuccinic acid), and D-penicillamine).

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^11658sTo]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal pain in U.S. emergency departments — burden and imaging trends: Abdominal pain has remained the most frequent chief complaint from 2009 to 2018, accounting for 7.1%–8.8% of ED visits annually, and more than 50% of ED abdominal pain patients undergo some form of imaging. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) use for abdominal pain grew from 1.4% to 31.7% between 1996 and 2007 and remained high, with CTAP use at 25.3% in 2007, peaking at 30.1% in 2010, and reaching 28.6% in 2013; by 2007, CTAP for abdominal pain constituted 12.8% of all CT-associated ED visits. In 2018, 10.7 million ED CTAPs were performed, representing 8.2% of all ED visits. Despite increasing imaging rates (CTAP from 10.1% in 2001 to 22.5% in 2005; ultrasound from 11.1% to 13.6%), diagnoses such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, and gallbladder disorders did not increase and hospital admissions did not decrease, and more than half of ED abdominal pain patients are discharged home without any specific diagnosis.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: modern concepts and management options [^114HePgq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, manifesting as abdominal pain/discomfort and altered bowel function. Despite affecting as many as 20% of adults, a lack of understanding of etiopathogenesis and evaluation strategies results in diagnostic uncertainty, and in turn frustration of both the physician and the patient. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome, with attention to evidence-based approaches. A 4-step treatment strategy that has been used successfully in our tertiary referral practice is presented and should lead to successful therapeutic outcomes in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and for efficient throughput of patients. Decision making in patients with abdominal pain on the basis of clinical and laboratory evaluation alone can result in unnecessary interventions or in delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, of which ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are the most often used, can assist in clinical decision making. Imaging has been shown to have a positive effect on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, to lead to changes in decisions about management, and to increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has been responsible for an increase in hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of exposure to radiation in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has made available guidelines for imaging in patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. This differentiation of use of imaging with patient tailored guidelines may not be sufficient to cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification of urgent conditions, without exposing patients to unnecessary forms of imaging. Unfortunately, many of the studies on imaging for acute abdominal pain have evaluated investigations in isolation, and several show methodological shortcomings such as retrospective collection of data or differential verification of test results.

We evaluated the added value of plain radiographs, ultrasonography, and computed tomography after clinical evaluation for making urgent diagnoses in patients presenting with abdominal pain. We compared the accuracy and costs of 11 diagnostic strategies, by using data systematically collected in a consecutive series of unselected patients presenting with acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain at the emergency department, all of whom were investigated with a structured overcomplete imaging protocol.

### Improvement in constipation and diarrhea is associated with improved abdominal pain in patients with functional bowel disorders [^111ES4Bz]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a bothersome and lifestyle limiting symptom in patients with functional bowel disorders. It is associated with decreased quality of life in affected individuals, as well as significant annual healthcare expenditure. Knowledge of specific factors that predict improvement in abdominal pain in those with functional bowel disorders is thus far limited.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting for outpatient care at a major academic medical center between October 2017 and March 2020 completed an electronic symptom survey prior to initial clinic visit, and again after 3 months. The Rome IV questionnaires for functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea were all included. Additionally, all subjects completed the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety, Depression, and sleep disturbance questionnaires. Patients with a diagnosis of a Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorder without any organic cause for symptoms were identified based on both chart review as well as survey response data. Univariable and multivariable analysis was used to assess predictors of improved abdominal pain after 3 months.

Key Results

180 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years were included in the final analysis. 78.3% of patients were female, and 77.2% met Rome IV criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. On multivariable analysis, improvement in constipation and diarrhea were both independent predictors of improved abdominal pain after 3 months.

Conclusions and Inferences

Improvement in constipation and diarrhea both predicted improvement in abdominal pain, suggesting that addressing these factors is central to the management of abdominal pain in functional gastrointestinal disorders.

### Chronic abdominal pain in children [^116rwwkK]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain, defined as long-lasting intermittent or constant abdominal pain, is a common pediatric problem encountered by primary care physicians, medical subspecialists, and surgical specialists. Chronic abdominal pain in children is usually functional, that is, without objective evidence of an underlying organic disorder. The Subcommittee on Chronic Abdominal Pain of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition has prepared this report based on a comprehensive, systematic review and rating of the medical literature. This report accompanies a clinical report based on the literature review and expert opinion. The subcommittee examined the diagnostic and therapeutic value of a medical and psychological history, diagnostic tests, and pharmacologic and behavioral therapy. The presence of alarm symptoms or signs (such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent fever, chronic severe diarrhea, and significant vomiting) is associated with a higher prevalence of organic disease. There was insufficient evidence to state that the nature of the abdominal pain or the presence of associated symptoms (such as anorexia, nausea, headache, and joint pain) can discriminate between functional and organic disorders. Although children with chronic abdominal pain and their parents are more often anxious or depressed, the presence of anxiety, depression, behavior problems, or recent negative life events does not distinguish between functional and organic abdominal pain. Most children who are brought to the primary care physician's office for chronic abdominal pain are unlikely to require diagnostic testing. Pediatric studies of therapeutic interventions were examined and found to be limited or inconclusive.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^111tYfaK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 low-risk recurrent abdominal pain — implementation and audit guidance states that the recommendations are conditional and supported only by low-level indirect evidence and that an audit mechanism may be inappropriate, other than to gather new research data to support future guidelines; disparities in care including intensity of diagnostic resources and analgesia were identified, and audit mechanisms to evaluate disparities should be used with caution to identify areas for future research and to generate hypotheses, not to judge the quality of care.

Nonpharmacologic analgesic therapies for low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain — evidence gap: The review reports no direct evidence for nonpharmacologic therapies in low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain, with no studies of acupuncture for nontraumatic abdominal pain in the emergency setting; identified nerve block studies were perioperative (not ED) and not for recurrent pain, and studies of other modalities had small samples, outpatient time frames, or methodological limitations such as lack of comparator groups or blinding; two meta-analyses of acupuncture for diverse forms of pain in emergency care were confounded by biases including inadequate blinding.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### Duration of symptoms and follow-up patterns of patients discharged from the emergency department after presenting with abdominal or flank pain [^113kPwLY]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the duration of symptoms and follow-up patterns of patients seen in emergency departments for abdominal or flank pain.

Objective

We aimed to measure the duration of symptoms and follow-up rate of patients discharged home from the emergency department after presenting with non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain.

Methods

We conducted a single-centre, prospective descriptive study of adult patients who presented to our emergency department with non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain and were discharged from the emergency department. We gathered clinical data during the index emergency department visit and conducted telephone interviews of subjects 2–5 weeks later.

Results

We reached 63 of 90 subjects (70%). The median duration of pain was 3 days after the emergency department visit. During the follow-up period, only 41% had followed-up with their family physician or primary care provider, although an additional 21% had planned to. Persistence of symptoms was common in the 37% of subjects who did not follow-up.

Conclusion

Of subjects discharged from the emergency department after visits for non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain, most improve within several days. Fewer than half follow-up with a family practitioner or a primary care provider. Emergency department revisits are uncommon and often for unrelated problems.
