## Question

why is kerendia approved for ckd and diabetes but other MRAs are not?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why finerenone (Kerendia) is approved for chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes while other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are not. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinction between nonsteroidal and steroidal MRAs. Then, I should review the pivotal clinical trials that established finerenone's benefits in diabetic CKD. Next, I will examine the evidence gaps for spironolactone and eplerenone in this specific population. After that, I need to assess comparative safety, especially hyperkalemia and hormonal adverse effects. I will then consider mechanistic and pharmacokinetic advantages that could underlie different risk–benefit profiles. Finally, I should confirm how guidelines and regulators translated this evidence into recommendations and labeling, and synthesize the conclusion carefully without overreaching beyond the data.

> Let me first confirm the key pharmacologic distinction, because that frames everything else. Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, highly selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist designed for cardiorenal disease, whereas spironolactone and eplerenone are older steroidal MRAs with broader steroid receptor interactions and differing tissue distribution and metabolites; this translates into different efficacy–safety tradeoffs in CKD populations, especially those at risk of hyperkalemia and hormonal side effects [^111t9k3i].

> Next, I should review the definitive outcomes data for finerenone in type 2 diabetes with CKD. The FIDELIO-DKD trial showed that finerenone, on top of maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB, reduced a kidney composite outcome defined by kidney failure, sustained 40% eGFR decline, or renal death, and also reduced a key cardiovascular composite outcome; these were hard outcomes, not just surrogate albuminuria changes [^112Fzz98]. Wait, let me verify the eGFR threshold used across analyses: FIDELIO's primary kidney outcome used a sustained 40% eGFR decline, but in the prespecified pooled FIDELITY analysis across FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD the kidney composite used a sustained 57% eGFR decline (approximately a doubling of serum creatinine), with significant reductions in both kidney and cardiovascular composites, which corroborates benefit across the CKD spectrum in T2D [^11479uJM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without contrasting that to steroidal MRAs in diabetic CKD. I need to check if spironolactone or eplerenone ever demonstrated comparable, large-scale, hard kidney or cardiovascular outcome benefits in this exact population. Systematic reviews and overviews indicate that steroidal MRA studies in diabetic CKD were small, short in duration, and largely focused on surrogate outcomes like albuminuria and blood pressure, with no definitive effects on ESKD or major adverse cardiovascular events reported, highlighting an outcomes evidence gap relative to finerenone's phase 3 program [^111SZZE3].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability, because regulatory decisions in CKD hinge on risk mitigation. Steroidal MRAs roughly double hyperkalemia risk in CKD cohorts and increase gynecomastia due to off-target androgen/progesterone receptor effects, while the long-acting metabolite canrenone can prolong hyperkalemia even after discontinuation; these liabilities complicate chronic use in CKD and limit dose intensity and adherence [^111SZZE3] [^111JV4Pj]. With finerenone, hyperkalemia events occurred more frequently than placebo but were generally manageable with monitoring, dose adjustment, and temporary holds, with a relatively low rate of permanent discontinuation for hyperkalemia in pooled analyses, and without hormonal adverse effects, supporting a more favorable risk–benefit profile in albuminuric T2D CKD patients [^116yB6Df] [^116ESk3n].

> Let me think about mechanistic and pharmacokinetic aspects that could underpin these differences. Finerenone exhibits high MR selectivity, different cofactor recruitment, and balanced distribution to kidney and heart, aligning with clinically observed anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects that extend beyond hemodynamics; these properties may enable cardiorenal protection with less off-target hormonal toxicity and potentially a different hyperkalemia profile compared with steroidal MRAs in CKD [^111t9k3i] [^116kMrt3]. But wait, I should verify that I'm not overstating class generalization: while other nonsteroidal MRAs (for example, esaxerenone, apararenone) have favorable effects on albuminuria, finerenone is currently the only agent in this class with robust phase 3 hard-outcome data and regulatory approval in T2D CKD, so extrapolation should be cautious [^111JmgcC].

> Next, I should review contemporary guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with practice standards. The ADA 2024 Standards recommend initiating a nonsteroidal MRA with proven benefits in patients with T2D CKD and sufficient eGFR, emphasizing reductions in CKD progression and cardiovascular events beyond ACEi/ARB and often alongside SGLT2 inhibitors [^1144F9qb]. KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends a nonsteroidal MRA with proven kidney or cardiovascular benefits for adults with T2D, eGFR greater than 25, normal potassium, and persistent albuminuria despite RAAS blockade, while reserving steroidal MRAs for other indications such as heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension, reflecting distinct evidence bases and safety considerations in CKD [^1177jnLE] [^113T27Vu]. The ESC 2023 guidance similarly endorses finerenone in T2D CKD to reduce cardiovascular events and kidney failure, integrating it with ACEi/ARB therapy in eligible patients [^116ciTo5] [^116rzXj3].

> I will now examine the regulatory pathway to ensure I'm accurate about labeling. Finerenone received approval specifically for CKD associated with type 2 diabetes to reduce risks of sustained eGFR decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization, on the strength of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD programs and their pooled analyses; no comparable diabetic CKD outcome trials exist for spironolactone or eplerenone to support a label expansion in this population, which is why they remain approved primarily for indications like heart failure or hypertension rather than diabetic CKD progression reduction [^114mw3oy] [^111t9k3i]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that other nonsteroidal MRAs share this label; to be precise, finerenone is the only nonsteroidal MRA currently approved for this indication, whereas others remain investigational or approved for different uses depending on the region, which reinforces the unique status of finerenone here [^111JmgcC].

> Let me reconsider the full chain of logic and ensure there are no gaps. The decisive factors are: dedicated, adequately powered trials with hard renal and cardiovascular endpoints in the exact target population; a risk–benefit profile that is acceptable in CKD with manageable hyperkalemia and no hormonal side effects; mechanistic plausibility consistent with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects; and concordant endorsements from major guidelines and regulators emphasizing a nonsteroidal MRA in T2D CKD. In contrast, steroidal MRAs lack large diabetic CKD outcome trials and have safety profiles that complicate sustained use in CKD, which collectively explains why finerenone is approved for this indication while spironolactone and eplerenone are not [^112Fzz98] [^11479uJM] [^111SZZE3] [^1144F9qb] [^1177jnLE] [^114mw3oy].

---

Kerendia (finerenone) is approved for CKD with T2D because it is the only MRA with **robust, dedicated phase 3 trials** (FIDELIO-DKD [^112Fzz98], FIGARO-DKD [^11479uJM]) showing significant reductions in kidney failure, sustained eGFR decline, and cardiovascular events in this population. In contrast, **steroidal MRAs lack outcomes trials** in CKD with T2D [^111SZZE3] and have higher hyperkalemia risk, limiting use in advanced CKD [^111JV4Pj]. Finerenone's approval [^114mw3oy] reflects its **superior safety profile** and guideline support for CKD with T2D [^1144F9qb], whereas steroidal MRAs are reserved for heart failure or resistant hypertension [^113T27Vu].

## Clinical trial evidence supporting finerenone

Finerenone's approval is supported by two large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled **phase 3 trials**, with a pooled analysis [^111JmgcC]:

- **FIDELIO-DKD**: 5,734 patients with CKD and T2D; finerenone reduced the primary kidney composite (kidney failure, sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, or renal death) by 18% (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73–0.93, p = 0.001) and the key cardiovascular composite by 14% (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.99, p = 0.03) [^112Fzz98].

- **FIGARO-DKD**: 7,437 patients with CKD and T2D; finerenone reduced the primary cardiovascular composite (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or HF hospitalization) by 13% (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–0.98, p = 0.03) and slowed CKD progression.

- **FIDELITY pooled analysis**: 13,026 patients; finerenone reduced the kidney composite by 23% (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.88, p = 0.0002) and the cardiovascular composite by 14% (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.95, p = 0.0018) [^11479uJM].

These trials enrolled patients with **eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²** and **albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/g** [^11479uJM], all receiving maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB [^112Fzz98], and showed consistent benefits across CKD stages and albuminuria levels.

---

## Safety profile of finerenone

Finerenone has a **favorable safety profile**, particularly regarding hyperkalemia:

- **Hyperkalemia**: More frequent than placebo but generally mild and manageable [^11479uJM]; hyperkalemia-related permanent discontinuation was low (1.7% vs 0.6% with placebo) [^116yB6Df].

- **Hormonal side effects**: Minimal gynecomastia or menstrual irregularities [^111JV4Pj] due to high MR selectivity [^116ESk3n].

- **Renal function**: No significant increase [^112Fzz98] in acute kidney injury or rapid eGFR decline compared to placebo.

---

## Limitations of steroidal MRAs in CKD with T2D

Steroidal MRAs (spironolactone, eplerenone) have **not been approved** for CKD with T2D due to several limitations:

- **Lack of dedicated outcomes trials**: No large, randomized trials [^111SZZE3] demonstrating hard renal or cardiovascular outcomes in CKD with T2D.

- **Hyperkalemia risk**: Higher incidence, especially in advanced CKD [^113T27Vu], limiting use and causing frequent discontinuations [^111SZZE3].

- **Hormonal side effects**: Gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and impotence limit tolerability [^111JV4Pj].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Reserved for heart failure or resistant hypertension, not CKD with T2D [^113T27Vu].

---

## Regulatory and guideline support

Finerenone has explicit **regulatory and guideline endorsement**: the FDA [^114mw3oy] approved it to reduce kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization in adults with CKD and T2D. The ADA 2024 guidelines [^1144F9qb] recommend finerenone to reduce cardiovascular events and CKD progression in patients with CKD and T2D who have albuminuria and are on maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB. KDIGO 2024 guidelines [^111PULxU] recommend finerenone for adults with T2D, eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m², normal potassium, and albuminuria > 30 mg/g [^1177jnLE] despite ACEi/ARB [^116ciTo5].

### Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: the FIDELITY pooled analysis [^11479uJM]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The complementary studies, FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) examined cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in different, overlapping stages of CKD. The purpose of the FIDELITY analysis was to perform an individual patient-level, pre-specified pooled efficacy and safety analysis across a broad spectrum of CKD to provide more robust estimates of the safety and efficacy of finerenone compared with placebo.

For this pre-specified analysis, two phase III, multi-centre, double-blind trials involving patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo, were combined. The main time-to-event efficacy outcomes were a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, and a composite of kidney failure, a sustained ≥ 57% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline over ≥ 4 weeks, or renal death. Among 13,026 patients with a median follow-up of 3.0 years (interquartile range 2.3–3.8 years), the composite cardiovascular outcome occurred in 825 (12.7%) patients receiving finerenone and 939 (14.4%) receiving placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78–0.95; P = 0.0018]. The composite kidney outcome occurred in 360 (5.5%) patients receiving finerenone and 465 (7.1%) receiving placebo (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.88; P = 0.0002). Overall safety outcomes were generally similar between treatment arms. Hyperkalaemia leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently in patients.

### Steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in cardiorenal medicine [^111SZZE3]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Despite growing evidence for MRA use in heart failure (HF), data from clinical trials of MRAs were sparse in patients with kidney failure. To address this, a proof-of-concept study assessed whether steroidal MRAs could protect the heart of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages II and III receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (N = 112). Spironolactone treatment resulted in reduced left ventricular mass and improved arterial stiffness after 40 weeks that was blood pressure (BP) independent.

In 2014, a Cochrane Database Systematic Review extended these observations to 27 studies (N = 1549) but covered fewer patients than those in RALES alone. Hard endpoints such as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or major adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects were not noted in these trials. Spironolactone decreased proteinuria and BP; however, aldosterone antagonist treatment had imprecise effects at the end of treatment on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (nine studies, N = 528; mean difference −2.55 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI −5.67 to 0.51). Steroidal MRAs doubled the risk of hyperkalaemia (11 studies, N = 632) with a risk ratio (RR) of 2.00 (95% CI 1.25–3.20), and a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 7.2 (95% CI 3.4 to ∞). Spironolactone increased the risk of gynaecomastia compared with ACEis or ARBs or both (four studies, N = 281): RR = 5.14, 95% CI 1.14–23.23; NNTH = 14.1, 95% CI 8.7–37.3. An updated 2019 systematic review evaluated the role of MRAs alone or on top of ACEi/ARB (31 studies, N = 2767) and noted…

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^1144F9qb]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend initiating a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. This recommendation is based on its proven effectiveness in clinical trials to reduce cardiovascular events and CKD progression. Importantly, this treatment should be considered if the eGFR is ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m², as patients with CKD and albuminuria face an increased risk for cardiovascular events and CKD progression.

### Effect of finerenone on chronic kidney disease outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^112Fzz98]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The FIDELIO DKD study, published by George L. Bakris and colleagues in 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine, is related to diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic kidney disease. The trial addressed the question: what is the long-term effect of finerenone on chronic kidney disease outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes?

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 5,674 patients (1,691 female, 3,983 male). Inclusion criteria required patients to have chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Key exclusion criteria included significant non-diabetic renal disease, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), dialysis for acute renal failure within 12 weeks of the run-in visit, the presence of a renal allograft, a scheduled kidney transplant within the next 12 months, or glycated hemoglobin HbA1c > 12%.

The interventions were as follows: a total of 2,833 patients received finerenone (either 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily), while 2,841 patients received a matching placebo tablet orally once daily.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease was observed in kidney failure, sustained decline of at least 40% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline, or death from renal causes (17.8% vs. 21.1%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant decrease was observed in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (13% vs. 14.8%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99). There was no significant difference in death from any cause (7.7% vs. 8.6%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.07).

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: Why, who, when, how, and what [^111JV4Pj]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone has been shown to attenuate albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease without outcomes data but had numerous disadvantages, including sexual side effects and significant hyperkalemia that can be prolonged for as long as one week after discontinuation due to long-acting metabolites, such as canrenone. That noted, spironolactone is evidence-based for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) based on the RALES trial and is also an excellent choice for resistant hypertension in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Lastly, spironolactone is generally used for patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Eplerenone is an additional steroidal MRA used for patients who cannot tolerate spironolactone. More recently, the selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone has been of interest given the activity of this receptor in diabetic kidney disease. In two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), finerenone has demonstrated significant cardiovascular and kidney protection for patients with proteinuric kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus when used with maximally tolerated ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). An additional benefit of finerenone is that it exhibited lower hyperkalemic events in addition to no sexual side effects observed with other less-selective MRAs. Importantly, finerenone should be avoided in those with decompensated cirrhosis. There are no head-to-head trials comparing spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone. Thus, for patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease (T2DM only), finerenone is recommended.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^113T27Vu]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

For patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. This treatment is suggested for heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension. It is important to recognize that such treatment may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular filtration, especially in patients with a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

### Potassium management with finerenone: Practical aspects [^116XiWGu]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol. Finerenone has high potency and selectivity for the MR, blocking MR‐mediated sodium reabsorption and overactivation. It also modifies tissue remodeling by exerting anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antiproliferative effects on both the kidney and the heart.

The Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) phase III trials evaluated the effect of this novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone. These trials investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone, on top of the maximum tolerated labeled dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The focus was on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with mild-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The FIDELIO-DKD trial was designed to demonstrate a treatment effect of finerenone on kidney endpoints, whereas the FIGARO-DKD trial was aimed at demonstrating an effect on a composite cardiovascular primary endpoint. Both trials included a broad range of patients with CKD and T2D. The FIDELITY analysis, with the complementary FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials, performed a pooled analysis of efficacy and safety at the individual patient level across a broad spectrum of CKD to provide more robust estimates.

### Management of hypertension and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and the Renal Association UK guideline update 2021 [^114cn8wC]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

More recently, finerenone, a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist with greater receptor selectivity than spironolactone and eplerenone, has been shown to provide a greater reduction in proteinuria and end organ damage compared with spironolactone or eplerenone. This was demonstrated in the Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability – diabetic nephropathy (ARTS-DN) study, involving 1,501 participants who were already receiving an ACEI or ARB. The mean age of the participants was 64.2 years; 37% had a UACR > 30 mg/mmol (> 265.49 mg/g), and 40% had an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or lower. Finerenone reduced the UACR at day 90 (relative to the baseline) more significantly than the placebo. The pre-specified secondary outcome of hyperkalaemia leading to discontinuation was not observed in either the placebo or finerenone group at various dosages. Additionally, there was no difference in terms of the incidence of a greater than 30% decrease in eGFR in either group. Thus, 2.5–10 mg of finerenone per day reduced albuminuria from the baseline in individuals with CKD and heart failure, with a lower incidence of hyperkalaemia than spironolactone. It was postulated that this new mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist may address the unmet medical need of safely managing albuminuria without affecting serum potassium in people with type 2 diabetes who have nephropathy. The strength of the study is that there was only a modest reduction in blood pressure at the highest dose of finerenone, quite unlike any other mineralocorticoid antagonist study in the past.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism for non-diabetic kidney disease [^112ssKfy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

Over the last three decades, numerous studies have shown that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism by steroidal MR antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone or eplerenone, or by nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone or esaxerenone, has beneficial effects in rodent models of non-diabetic kidney disease. These models have included acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia/reperfusion, the AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD) transition, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), 5/6th nephrectomy, glomerulonephritis, and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity models.

In these models, MRA administration has consistently shown benefits by preserving renal function and preventing interstitial fibrosis and glomerular damage through a reduction in pro-inflammatory and profibrotic mediators, oxidative stress, and the modulation of vasoactive factors. The impact of improved kidney function on the cardiovascular system has also been reported and shown to contribute to the global benefits of MRAs in non-diabetic kidney diseases. These protective effects have been attributed to the activation of the MR beyond those in classical aldosterone-sensitive distal nephrons, including in other cells inside (fibroblasts, podocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, inflammatory cells) and outside the kidney (cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, vessels, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells).

Therefore, MR antagonism has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target to inhibit the progression of kidney disease and improve overall renal and cardiovascular health.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated mechanisms in diabetic kidney disease and clinical significance of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^1164Anf1]. American Journal of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Recent advances highlight the aldosterone-MR-Rac1 triangle as a potential focus for novel therapies. The overactivity of each component of the triangle in diabetes, CKD, and cardiovascular disease, and its multidirectional capacity, potentiates the risks toward a proinflammatory and profibrotic milieu, and disease progression. Although aldosterone has MR-independent actions that are involved in the development of DKD, and Rac1 can be upregulated independently of MR activation, the MR is still a key element of this triangle, with clinical data supporting the use of MRAs in delaying the progression of DKD. With FDA and EMA approval of finerenone, the treatment of DKD has entered an exciting new era in MRA therapy addressing the inflammation and fibrosis component in slowing DKD progression, as well as reducing cardiovascular events.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1177jnLE]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to RAAS inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular benefits in adult patients with T2DM, eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m², normal serum potassium levels, and albuminuria > 30 mg/g despite the maximum tolerated dose of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor.

Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are most appropriate for adult patients with T2DM at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as indicated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies.

### Kidney outcomes with finerenone: An analysis from the FIGARO-DKD study [^1169ESaE]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2023). High credibility.

In patients with CKD and T2D, the effect of finerenone on kidney outcomes appeared to be more pronounced for severely increased albuminuria than for moderately increased albuminuria at baseline. Despite this, finerenone slowed the rate of chronic eGFR decline versus placebo in patients in both UACR subgroups; however, because the rate of eGFR decline was slower in patients with moderately increased albuminuria, longer follow-up periods may be required to observe a reduction in risk of kidney failure and sustained eGFR decline outcomes in these patients. In patients with moderately increased albuminuria, finerenone also slowed the rate of albuminuria progression, supporting the idea that finerenone can be expected to improve kidney outcomes over the long term in these patients.

Previous research has shown that changes in albuminuria are associated with subsequent risk of outcomes such as ESKD and sustained ≥ 57% decrease in eGFR across a range of cohorts. The kidney benefits of finerenone in patients with higher levels of albuminuria may indicate more glomerular inflammation and injury in these patients. Overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor and aldosterone upregulation may be contributors to this underlying kidney damage, and finerenone is hypothesized to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney via mineralocorticoid receptor blockade. Preclinical data have demonstrated that finerenone reduces proinflammatory and profibrotic markers in the kidney and the heart and prevents kidney glomerular and tubular damage.

### Effect of finerenone on albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy: A randomized clinical trial [^114HPDXw]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, when added to a renin-angiotensin system blocker, further reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease but may be underused due to a high risk of adverse events.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of different oral doses of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, given for 90 days to patients with diabetes and high or very high albuminuria who are receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 148 sites in 23 countries. Patients were recruited from June 2013 to February 2014, and the study was completed in August 2014. Of 1,501 screened patients, 823 were randomized, and 821 received the study drug.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral, once-daily finerenone in doses of 1.25 mg/d (n = 96), 2.5 mg/d (n = 92), 5 mg/d (n = 100), 7.5 mg/d (n = 97), 10 mg/d (n = 98), 15 mg/d (n = 125), and 25 mg/d (n = 119) or matching placebo (n = 94) for 90 days.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the ratio of the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) at day 90 compared to baseline. Safety endpoints included changes from baseline in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

- **Results**: The mean age of the participants was 64.2 years, with 78% being male. At baseline, 36.7% of patients treated had very high albuminuria (UACR ≥ 300 mg/g), and 40.0% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Design and rationale of FINE-REAL: A prospective study of finerenone in clinical practice [^1174qaUT]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2023). High credibility.

The contemporary patterns of care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the adoption of finerenone are not well understood. The FINE-REAL study (NCT05348733) is a prospective observational study investigating the use of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone in clinical practice.

FINE-REAL is an international, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study enrolling approximately 5,500 adults with CKD and T2D across an estimated 200 sites in 22 countries. The study is anticipated to be ongoing until 2027.

- **Primary objective**: Describe treatment patterns in patients with CKD and T2D treated with finerenone in routine clinical practice.
- **Secondary objectives**: Assess safety with finerenone. Other endpoints include characterization of healthcare resource utilization and the occurrence or progression of diabetic retinopathy from baseline in patients with existing disease. A biobank is being organized for future exploratory analyses, including participants from the United States.

FINE-REAL is the first prospective observational study with a nonsteroidal MRA in a population with CKD and T2D. It is expected to provide meaningful insights into the treatment of CKD associated with T2D and inform decision-making on the initiation of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2D.

### Effect of finerenone on chronic kidney disease outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^114xUw48]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Finerenone, a nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, reduced albuminuria in short-term trials involving patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes; however, its long-term effects on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are unknown.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5,734 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to receive finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area, and diabetic retinopathy, or they had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5,000 and an eGFR of 25 to less than 75 mL per minute per 1.73 m². All the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes. The key secondary composite outcome, also assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 504 of 2,833 patients (17.8%) in the finerenone group.

### A randomized controlled study of finerenone vs. eplerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease [^115w1Ku6]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and are recommended in European and US guidelines for symptomatic patients with HFrEF. While both spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown to be effective in patients with HFrEF, they may be underused or inconsistently prescribed in hospitalized patients with worsening heart failure (HF) due to a high risk of adverse events. Furthermore, patients with common co-morbidities of HF, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), are at particular risk of developing hyperkalemia, so they may be less likely to receive currently available MRA therapy due to safety concerns. Thus, there is an unmet medical need in patients with worsening HFrEF and impaired kidney function, which is not being met using currently available MRAs.

Finerenone (BAY 94–8862) is a novel non-steroidal MRA, with higher selectivity towards the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) compared with spironolactone and stronger MR-binding affinity than eplerenone. This combination of potency and selectivity towards the MR, and a balanced tissue distribution into heart and kidney compared with spironolactone or eplerenone, could result in more pronounced cardiorenal protection, particularly in high-risk patients with impaired kidney function. The phase 2a mineralocorticoid Receptor antagonist Tolerability Study (ARTS) trial showed that in patients with HFrEF and mild CKD, finerenone (5.0–10.0 mg/d).

### Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: The FIDELITY pooled analysis [^116yB6Df]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Owing to its mechanism of action, finerenone treatment is expected to increase serum potassium concentration through MR antagonism. In FIDELITY, hyperkalaemia was more frequent with finerenone compared to placebo. However, the incidence of hyperkalaemia-related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalaemia-related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone compared to 0.6% with placebo over a median follow-up of 3.0 years (IQR 2.3–3.8 years). Hypokalaemia occurred less frequently in finerenone-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Therefore, finerenone improves cardiorenal outcomes in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes with a manageable hyperkalaemia risk and a reduction in hypokalaemia. The hypokalaemia reduction is notable because it is causatively associated with adverse outcomes in heart failure.

Although this prespecified pooled analysis of two studies with similar protocols included a large patient population with CKD and type 2 diabetes, limitations are that it did not include patients with non-albuminuric CKD and only a small proportion of Black patients were included. Since the design of the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD studies, SGLT-2 inhibitors have emerged as therapeutic options for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes. Some patients in the finerenone phase III trials also received these novel agents.

### Steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in cardiorenal medicine [^111t9k3i]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

MR overactivation results in deleterious effects on the kidneys and heart, promoting inflammation and fibrosis, and progression of kidney and cardiovascular (CV) disease; effects that extend beyond the well-recognized retention of salt and water, leading to downstream hypertension. Studies using MR knockout (MRKO) models have demonstrated that MR antagonism could play a key role in addressing the residual risk of progression of kidney and heart disease. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can be categorized as steroidal or nonsteroidal, with key differences in their molecular and pharmacological properties.

The novel, nonsteroidal, selective MRA finerenone shows several promising differences from steroidal MRAs in preclinical models, with a mechanism of action distinct from other emerging agents for cardiorenal medicine in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the Phase III randomized trial, FIDELIO-DKD, finerenone significantly reduced the primary and secondary composite endpoints compared to placebo, suggesting that finerenone may forestall progression to kidney failure in patients with CKD and T2D. The FIGARO-DKD study will further address whether finerenone can reduce the risk of major adverse CV events in this patient population. Combined, these studies should firmly establish the role of finerenone in cardiorenal medicine.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111sLuiP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Two recent prespecified subgroup analyses of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies investigated the efficacy of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2DM with and without heart failure. Patients with symptomatic HFrEF (NYHA II-IV) were excluded in both trials, meaning that heart failure patients at baseline had either asymptomatic HFrEF, HFrEF with NYHA class I, HFmrEF, or HFpEF. In the FIDELIO-DKD analysis, 436 (7.7%) of the overall population had a history of heart failure. Over a median follow-up of 2.6 years, the composite CV outcome of CV-death, non-fatal MI, and stroke or hospitalization for heart failure was significantly reduced by finerenone, independent of heart failure presence (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.50–1.06) and (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.77–1.04, respectively; P = 0.33). Similar results were reported in the FIGARO-DKD analysis, where 571 (7.8%) patients of the overall population had a history of heart failure at baseline. Consistently, the beneficial effects of finerenone on improving heart failure outcomes were not modified by the presence or absence of heart failure. Finerenone also significantly reduced the incidence of new-onset heart failure when compared to placebo. These data show for the first time favorable actions of the non-steroidal MRA finerenone in a larger population of heart failure patients with CKD and T2DM. Additionally, regarding the applicability of these data to patients with HFpEF, these results seem very important. The exclusion of patients with HFrEF in FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD increases the likelihood.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use and hard renal outcomes in real-world patients with chronic kidney disease [^116Rx6ZQ]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Preventing kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) is an ultimate treatment goal for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, the global number of patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been increasing, despite guideline-recommended therapies for CKD, including the use of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and ARB (angiotensin II receptor blockers). This may be partly because of the phenomenon of aldosterone breakthrough, where plasma aldosterone levels increase in patients on long-term ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, attenuating the renoprotective effects of these treatments. Thus, reinforcing the conventional treatment strategy for patients with CKD remains a major clinical issue.

It has been suggested that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) exert renoprotective effects. Inhibition of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling attenuates glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and podocyte injuries by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress in CKD model animals. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an antiproteinuric effect of MRAs in CKD patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, in a recent RCT of patients with type 2 diabetes, a nonsteroidal selective MRA, finerenone, reduced the risk of hard renal outcomes. However, this finding was limited to albuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes and mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction because of the trial population. Notably, there has been a lack of real-world evidence examining the association between MRA use and hard renal outcomes in broader patient populations.

### Non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^111JmgcC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) presents a major health challenge, associated with a disproportionately high burden of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and death. This review summarizes the rationale, clinical evidence, and practical implementation for non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs), a drug class now approved and recommended for patients with T2D and CKD at risk of cardiorenal disease progression.

Three nsMRAs — finerenone, esaxerenone, and apararenone — have been evaluated, but finerenone is currently the only approved nsMRA for this indication. Two large-scale, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies evaluated finerenone added to a maximally tolerated dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker. Over more than two years of treatment, finerenone was associated with a significant reduction in composite endpoints of renal and cardiovascular outcomes versus placebo. Esaxerenone and apararenone have both shown significant improvements in albuminuria versus placebo.

In general, nsMRAs were well tolerated. Hyperkalaemia was the most notable treatment-related adverse event and could generally be managed through serum potassium monitoring and dose adjustments. The nsMRAs are now an important component of the recommended treatment for CKD associated with T2D, providing a significant reduction in the risk of cardiorenal progression beyond what can be achieved with glucose and blood pressure control.

### Finerenone in diabetic kidney disease: A systematic review and critical appraisal [^116ESk3n]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). High credibility.

- **Aims**: Finerenone is a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist (MRA) recently approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aim to conduct a systematic review of finerenone to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone in CKD with or without T2D.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar from inception until September 9, 2022, using several MeSH keywords related to finerenone. Ongoing trials were additionally searched on ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Results**: At the time of writing, five phase 2 and three phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies of finerenone have been published, with several other randomized and real-world studies of finerenone currently ongoing.

- **Conclusions**: In short-term studies involving patients with CKD and reduced ejection heart failure, with or without T2D, finerenone 20 mg appears to yield better renal outcomes compared with spironolactone and better mortality outcomes compared with eplerenone, with significantly less hyperkalemia than both spironolactone and eplerenone. In long-term studies involving patients with CKD and T2D, finerenone 10/20 mg significantly reduces the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular endpoints (especially heart failure hospitalization) compared to placebo. Finerenone has no effect on HbA1c, body weight, or sexual side effects, including gynecomastia, and only a modest effect on blood pressure. However, hyperkalemia leading to drug withdrawal was significantly higher with finerenone.

### Finerenone in patients across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use [^116oczFW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

This FIDELITY subgroup analysis showed consistent cardiovascular and kidney benefits with finerenone compared with placebo, irrespective of whether a patient was receiving GLP‐1RA treatment at baseline or at any time concomitant with study treatment. In addition, a significantly greater reduction in UACR was observed with finerenone in patients taking a GLP‐1RA at baseline compared with those without GLP‐1RA use at baseline. These findings build on the observation from the FIDELIO‐DKD trial that suggested finerenone was associated with consistent reduction in UACR, irrespective of GLP‐1RA use at baseline. The data add to the body of information regarding the effects of finerenone and GLP‐1RA co‐administration on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes.

Currently, GLP‐1RAs are recommended in the European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes, American Diabetes Association, and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for patients with T2D and a history of cardiovascular disease, in patients with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and for the management of glucose as the preferred drug after metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors because of their cardiovascular benefit.

Moreover, results from GLP‐1RA clinical studies demonstrate that GLP‐1RA use leads to a reduction of albuminuria. The observations from the analysis suggest that concomitant use of finerenone and GLP‐1RAs may provide additional protection in patients with CKD and T2D, although limitations of this analysis should be considered, including differences in baseline characteristics.

### Combination effect of finerenone and empagliflozin in participants with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes using a UACR endpoint (CONFIDENCE) trial: baseline clinical characteristics [^114Qrkwk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

While contemporary trials in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have required the use of maximally tolerated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as background therapy, detailed data on the initiation and combination of therapies are lacking for individuals with CKD and type 2 diabetes (T2D), especially regarding whether these drugs should be initiated sequentially or simultaneously. Secondary analyses of FIDELITY, a pooled analysis of the FIGARO-DKD (NCT02540993) and FIDELIO-DKD (NCT02545049) trials, suggested a potential additive effect of finerenone and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) on kidney and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in a subset of participants with CKD and T2D.

The potential for an additive effect of finerenone and SGLT2is on kidney and CV outcomes in T2D is supported by their distinct, yet complementary, mechanisms of action. Using population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the pooled analysis of FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD (FIDELITY), Eissing et al. provided evidence for a potential additive effect of finerenone with an SGLT2i on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)-lowering and chronic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. However, no trial has yet evaluated the safety and efficacy of simultaneously initiating an SGLT2i and finerenone in people with T2D and albuminuria.

The Combination effect of Finerenone and Empagliflozin in participants with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes using a UACR Endpoint (CONFIDENCE; NCT05254002; EudraCT 2021–003037–11) trial is investigating whether early combination therapy comprising finerenone and the SGLT2i empagliflozin is superior to either drug alone in reducing relevant clinical outcomes.

### Modifying chronic kidney disease progression with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112vC6e1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Results from FIDELIO-DKD showed that in patients with DKD and T2D, treatment with finerenone significantly slowed the progression of DKD. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, finerenone compared with placebo decreased the primary composite outcome (kidney failure, sustained GFR decrease by ≥ 40%, death from renal cause) by 18% [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.93, p = .001]. Finerenone also significantly reduced the key secondary composite outcome (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or heart failure hospitalization) by 14% (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.99, p = .03) compared with placebo.

These effects were seen as early as 1 month into the trial and persisted throughout, indicating that finerenone protects against adverse CV outcomes in patients with DKD and T2D. Finerenone had a modest effect to reduce systolic blood pressure (decrements from baseline to month 1 and to month 12 were −3.0 and −2.1 mmHg, respectively, compared with −0.1 and 0.9 mmHg, respectively, with placebo). Finerenone had no effect on glycated haemoglobin A1c, indicating that the drug's beneficial renoprotective effects were mediated via non-glycaemic mechanisms.

### Finerenone in patients across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use [^117HFCd2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, this exploratory FIDELITY subgroup analysis supports the hypothesis that the kidney and cardiovascular outcome benefits in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are maintained with finerenone treatment, irrespective of treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), with no apparent safety signals observed with the concomitant use of finerenone and a GLP-1RA. Interpretation of the potential beneficial effect of this combination is somewhat limited by the small sample size and number of events in this analysis. However, given that guidelines recommend the use of finerenone as a goal-directed treatment in patients with T2D who are at risk for cardiovascular events or CKD progression, and who may already be receiving a GLP-1RA for glycemic control, additional randomized trials are required to further assess if the combination of a selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with GLP-1RAs, in addition to renin-angiotensin system inhibition, would provide incremental cardiorenal benefits for patients.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: A clinical practice guideline [^114jZcxv]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2025). High credibility.

In the context of managing diabetic nephropathy, particularly concerning RAAS inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, the DC 2025 guidelines recommend initiating a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, such as finerenone, which has demonstrated efficacy. This should be done alongside potassium monitoring for adult patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, characterized by an eGFR of 25–90 mL/min/1.73 m² and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 3–30 mg/mmol, with or without diabetic retinopathy. It is advised for those with an eGFR of 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m² or an eGFR of greater than 25 mL/min/1.73 m² with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–500 mg/mmol, who are on maximally tolerated or prescribed doses of RAAS inhibitors and have a serum potassium level of ≤ 4.8 mmol/L. This approach aims to improve both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Rationale and design of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist tolerability study-heart failure (ARTS-HF): a randomized study of finerenone vs. eplerenone in patients who have worsening chronic heart failure with diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease [^113XKXzR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone, in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) who are at high risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening renal dysfunction.

The MinerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study-Heart Failure (ARTS-HF; NCT01807221) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled, six-parallel-group, phase 2b dose-finding study. In total, 1060 patients with HFrEF and concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be randomized within 7 days of emergency presentation to the hospital for worsening chronic HF to receive finerenone (one of five doses in the range 2.5–20.0 mg once daily) or eplerenone (25 mg every second day to 50 mg once daily for 90 days).

The primary objective is to investigate the safety and potential efficacy, measured as the percentage of individuals with a decrease in plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of more than 30% relative to baseline at day 90 ± 2, of different oral doses of finerenone compared with eplerenone. Other objectives are to assess the effects of finerenone on a composite clinical endpoint (death from any cause, cardiovascular hospitalizations, or emergency presentations for worsening chronic HF), and on changes in health-related quality of life from baseline.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^116ciTo5]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend initiating finerenone in addition to ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). This is advised to reduce cardiovascular events and kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmol (≥ 300 mg/g), or an eGFR of 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 3 mg/mmol (≥ 30 mg/g).

### Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated mechanisms in diabetic kidney disease and clinical significance of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^116kMrt3]. American Journal of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis actions of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) address an important mechanism of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) not specifically modulated by glucose-lowering medications such as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The residual mean loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in DKD on maximally tolerated doses of ACE inhibitors (or ARBs) and SGLT2 inhibitors remains high, with a least-squares mean change in eGFR slope of −3.19 mL/min/1.73 m²/year and a standard error of 0.15.

A potential synergistic effect of combination therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs in slowing the progression of kidney disease is suggested, due to the differing mechanisms of action of these drug classes. The FIDELITY pooled analysis of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials, where 6.7% of patients received an SGLT2 inhibitor and 7.2% a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist at baseline, demonstrated that the cardiorenal benefits from finerenone remained independent of SGLT2 inhibitor use.

Triple therapy with an ACE inhibitor, an SGLT2 inhibitor, and an MRA — especially in patients with residual albuminuria of ≥ 300 mg/g — might have the potential to slow DKD progression, reduce albuminuria, and lower cardiovascular events. Further studies could help determine the patient population who would benefit most from this combination and delineate the additional reduction of yearly eGFR decline, as well as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) reduction, when finerenone is added to an SGLT2 inhibitor. A study evaluating the combination of these agents is ongoing.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and reno-protection: What's the evidence & where do they fit? A guide for non-specialists [^116eZaqX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The role of aldosterone has yet to be well appreciated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Two variables define CKD: an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30mg/g. Both are needed for an accurate diagnosis. The presence of CKD at this level is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular death and a greater risk of CKD progression to kidney failure and subsequent dialysis. This paper presents an overview of aldosterone's importance in CKD and its contribution to the inflammatory processes involved in CKD development. Data on outcomes related to CKD progression will also be discussed in the context of mineralocorticoid blockade.

Based on recent epidemiological data as well as data examining markers of diabetic kidney disease progression, it is clear that the use of both renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists has a significant role in altering the natural history of kidney disease progression itself, as well as reducing the risk of cardiovascular events that generally accompany long-standing kidney disease. This paper discusses these issues and the management of consequent hyperkalaemia when both steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used in detail.

### Outcomes with finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes: A FIDELITY subgroup analysis [^112eAuoz]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes have limited treatment options to reduce their persistent cardiovascular and kidney risk. In the Finerenone in Chronic Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes (FIDELITY) study, a prespecified pooled analysis of Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD), finerenone improved heart-kidney outcomes in participants with CKD and type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: This FIDELITY subgroup analysis investigated the effects of finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m²). Efficacy outcomes included a cardiovascular composite (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) and a kidney composite (kidney failure, sustained ≥ 57% decrease in eGFR from baseline, or kidney disease death).

- **Results**: Of 13,023 participants, 890 (7%) had stage 4 CKD. The hazard ratio for the risk of the cardiovascular composite outcome with finerenone versus placebo was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.07). The kidney composite outcome proportional hazards assumption was not met for the overall study period, with a protective effect only shown up to 2 years, after which the direction of association was inconsistent, and an observed loss of precision over time incurred on finerenone versus placebo risk differences. Nonetheless, albuminuria and rate of eGFR decline were consistently reduced with finerenone versus placebo.

### When to use spironolactone, eplerenone or finerenone in the spectrum of cardiorenal diseases [^112VYsL6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney disease frequently coexists with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, and this dual presence significantly amplifies the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms and common CV risk factors contribute to the increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptors, which, in turn, can drive the progression of chronic CV-kidney disorders. The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone have demonstrated efficacy in improving patient outcomes in cases of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or following a myocardial infarction but have limited value in patients with chronic kidney disease. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone has now established itself as a foundational guideline-recommended therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. At the time of writing, these pharmacological agents have been developed in distinct patient populations. The consequences of their distinct pharmacological profiles necessitate further consideration. They have not undergone testing across the entire spectrum of cardiorenal scenarios, and the evidence base is currently being complemented with ongoing trials.

In this review, we aim to synthesize the existing body of evidence and chart the future trajectory for the use of spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone in improving clinical outcomes across the diverse spectrum of cardiorenal diseases. By consolidating the state of knowledge, we seek to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making in the management of patients with these complex and interconnected conditions.

### Design of the combination effect of finerenone and empagliflozin in participants with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes using a UACR endpoint study (CONFIDENCE) [^111RBXmd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

- **Key learning points**: Despite approved interventions, people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) face an increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular (CV) morbidity, and all-cause mortality. There is a growing need to slow or attenuate the progression of CKD and reduce CV morbidity and mortality in this population. Finerenone, a selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) each contribute to reducing adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with CKD and T2D.

- **What this study adds**: CONFIDENCE is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, international, multicenter, three-armed, parallel-group, Phase 2 study involving 807 adults with CKD and T2D. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to undergo 180 days of treatment with finerenone and empagliflozin, finerenone and matching placebo to empagliflozin, or empagliflozin and matching placebo to finerenone. Trial evidence consistently shows a close association between the lowering of the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) and improved CV and kidney outcomes. A greater reduction in UACR is linked to greater CV or kidney benefits. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the dual initiation of finerenone and empagliflozin is superior in reducing UACR compared to either empagliflozin or finerenone alone. This trial will inform the scientific and clinical communities about whether dual therapy with finerenone and empagliflozin provides additive benefits to patients with CKD and T2D.

### Finerenone in patients across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use [^117JrpHd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: This analysis combines individual patient‐level data from the FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD Phase III clinical trials; the designs and results of these studies have been published previously. Briefly, adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were receiving maximum-tolerated, labeled renin‐angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were eligible to participate if they had a serum potassium level ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at screening. Patients with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of ≥ 30 to 108 mmol/mol (> 12%) at screening were not eligible to participate. There were no restrictions on the use of antidiabetic treatment, and the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) was permitted at baseline and throughout the trial, as was the initiation of GLP‐1RA treatment during the trial.

During the study, healthcare providers were advised to follow local guidelines for the management of T2D, including recommendations for glycemic control. Patients were recruited from September 2015 to October 2018, a period when guidelines and recommendations for GLP‐1RA use in patients with T2D at risk of cardiovascular (CV) events were being updated. The trial protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each study site, and all patients provided written informed consent.

- **Randomization and masking**: In both studies, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive double‐blind therapy with either oral finerenone at titrated doses.

The KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend that, in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist should be considered as an addition to a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor and an SGLT-2 inhibitor in adult patients with T2DM and CKD.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for nephroprotection and cardioprotection in patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease [^113RPWN6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) develops in approximately 40% of patients with diabetes and is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Patients with CKD, especially those with diabetes mellitus, are at high risk of both developing kidney failure and cardiovascular (CV) death. The use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers to reduce the incidence of kidney failure in patients with DKD dates back to studies that are now over 20 years old. In recent years, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have shown beneficial renal effects in randomized trials. However, even in response to combined treatment with RAS blockers and SGLT2is, the renal residual risk remains high, with kidney failure only deferred and not avoided. The risk of CV death also remains high, even with optimal treatment.

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce albuminuria and surrogate markers of CV disease in patients already on optimal therapy. However, their use has been curtailed by the significant risk of hyperkalemia. In the FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in DKD (FIDELIO-DKD) study, comparing the actions of the non-steroidal MRA finerenone with placebo, finerenone reduced the progression of DKD and the incidence of CV events, with a relatively safe adverse event profile. This document presents in detail the available evidence on the cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects of MRAs, analyzes the potential mechanisms involved, and discusses their potential future place in the treatment of patients with diabetic CKD.

### Impact of finerenone-induced albuminuria reduction on chronic kidney disease outcomes in type 2 diabetes: A mediation analysis [^113VSbCN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, reduces cardiovascular and kidney failure outcomes. Finerenone also lowers the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Whether the finerenone-induced change in UACR mediates cardiovascular and kidney failure outcomes is unknown.

- **Objective**: To quantify the proportion of kidney and cardiovascular risk reductions seen over a 4-year period mediated by a change in kidney injury, as measured by the change in log UACR between baseline and month 4.

- **Design**: Post hoc mediation analysis using pooled data from two phase 3, double-blind trials of finerenone (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02540993 and NCT02545049).

- **Setting**: Several clinical sites in 48 countries.

- **Patients**: 12,512 patients with CKD and T2D.

- **Intervention**: Finerenone and placebo (1:1).

- **Measurements**: Separate mediation analyses were done for the composite kidney (kidney failure, sustained ≥ 57% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline [approximately a doubling of serum creatinine], or kidney disease death) and cardiovascular (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) outcomes.

Results: At baseline, the median UACR was 514 mg/g. A 30% or greater reduction in UACR was seen in 3,338 (53.2%) patients in the finerenone group and 1,684 (27.0%) patients in the placebo group. Reduction in UACR (analyzed as a continuous variable) mediated 84% and 37% of the treatment effect on the kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, respectively.

### A randomized controlled study of finerenone vs. eplerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease [^117MmxAB]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

These observations suggest a better outcome in the finerenone 10→20 mg group compared with the other finerenone groups and the eplerenone group. Combined with a safety profile comparable to that in the other groups, this indicates that the 10 mg once-daily dose of finerenone, uptitrated to 20 mg after 30 days, provides the best balance of safety and efficacy for further investigation in larger clinical trials.

Mechanisms may explain the decrease in the clinical composite endpoint in the finerenone (10→20 mg) group. Finerenone has a unique pharmacodynamic profile, which is the consequence of different physicochemical properties compared to steroidal MRAs. Physicochemical drug properties strongly impact plasma protein binding, vascular transport, and tissue penetration and distribution. Moreover, finerenone has a different mode of mineralocorticoid receptor inactivation compared with steroidal MRAs, leading to a pronounced suppression of downstream gene expression, hypertrophy reduction, and therefore improved organ protection. However, the reason outcomes seem particularly improved in the finerenone 10→20 mg compared to the 15→20 mg group is unclear at this stage.

Both finerenone and eplerenone were well tolerated overall, with a similar rate of adverse events across all study groups and a low incidence of renal events leading to hospitalization. Overall, 4.3% of patients experienced serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.6 mmol/L. A potassium concentration > 6.0 mmol/L was observed in only five patients.

### The potential role of finerenone in patients with type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^116hUFqU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a global health concern, associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as a decreased quality of life. Many patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) will develop CKD over their lifetime. Uncontrolled glucose levels, which occur in patients with T1D as well as type 2 diabetes (T2D), are associated with substantial mortality and cardiovascular disease burden. T2D and T1D share common pathological features of CKD, which is thought to be driven by haemodynamic dysfunction and metabolic disturbances, leading to an influx of inflammatory and profibrotic mediators. These mediators are major interrelated contributors to CKD progression.

The mineralocorticoid receptor is also involved in CKD progression. Under conditions of oxidative stress, salt loading, and hyperglycaemia, this receptor transitions from a homeostatic regulator to a pathophysiological mediator by promoting oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Progressive glomerular and tubular injury leads to macroalbuminuria, a progressive reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, and eventually end-stage renal disease.

Finerenone, a non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of patients with CKD associated with T2D. However, the benefit of finerenone in patients with T1D has yet to be determined. This narrative review discusses the treatment of CKD in T1D and the potential future role of finerenone in this setting.

### Design of the combination effect of finerenone and empagliflozin in participants with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes using a UACR endpoint study (CONFIDENCE) [^111YahBs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Despite available interventions, people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Finerenone, a potent and selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) can reduce both kidney and cardiovascular risks in people with CKD and T2D. This study outlines the design to investigate whether dual therapy with finerenone and an SGLT2i is superior to either agent alone.

- **Methods**: CONFIDENCE (NCT05254002) is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, international, multicenter, three-armed, parallel-group, 7.5- to 8.5-month, Phase 2 study in 807 adults with T2D, stage 2–3 CKD, and a urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 300- < 5000 mg/g. The primary objective is to demonstrate that 6 months of dual therapy comprising finerenone and the SGLT2i empagliflozin is superior for reducing albuminuria versus either agent alone. Interventions will be once-daily finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg (target dose) plus empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 10 mg alone, or finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg (target dose) alone.

- **Results**: The primary outcome is a relative change from baseline in UACR among the three groups. Secondary outcomes will further characterize efficacy and safety, including changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and incident hyperkalemia.

- **Conclusions**: CONFIDENCE is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of dual use of finerenone and an SGLT2i in adults with CKD and T2D. If an additive effect is shown, it supports early and efficient intervention.

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^1147PjPi]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025).

- **Nonsteroidal MRAs**: Nonsteroidal MRAs were developed with the aim of improving the adverse event profile compared with steroidal MRAs while maintaining a potent blockade of the MR receptor. Only one nonsteroidal MRA, finerenone, is approved for slowing CKD progression in individuals with CKD in diabetes. Due to its unique binding mechanism, finerenone demonstrates increased selectivity for the MR over spironolactone and eplerenone. Finerenone also has a shorter half-life compared with spironolactone and eplerenone and recruits a different set of transcriptional coactivators.

Two studies have examined the effect of finerenone on CV and kidney outcomes in participants with T2D and CKD characterized by UACR ≥ 30 mg/g: the FIDELIO-DKD and the FIGARO-DKD studies. In the FIDELIO-DKD trial, finerenone reduced the occurrence of the primary composite kidney endpoint (kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from kidney causes) by 18% compared with placebo (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.73–0.93). In FIGARO-DKD, finerenone reduced the occurrence of the primary CV endpoint (composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF) by 13% compared with placebo (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76–0.98). Furthermore, the incidence of new-onset HF was significantly lower with finerenone than with placebo (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50–0.93).

### Outcomes with finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes: A FIDELITY subgroup analysis [^112NN5iE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Markedly, the cumulative incidence analysis in participants with stage 4 CKD suggested an initial delay in the time to experiencing a first kidney composite event (eGFR of < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² for most participants) in the finerenone versus placebo recipients, supporting possible early kidney protection with finerenone. For participants with stage 4 CKD, there was a slower accumulation of first kidney events in the finerenone versus placebo groups during the first two years of follow-up. Indeed, finerenone versus placebo risk differences over time suggested a reduction in the risk of kidney outcomes over the first two years. However, this effect was not consistent with the results observed beyond the two-year time point. Notably, risk difference CIs became larger and crossed 0, indicating a loss of precision after two years.

The lack of observable reduction in the kidney composite beyond the two-year time point in participants with stage 4 CKD may have been due to the severe state of irreversible kidney damage associated with this advanced disease, which might hinder long-term improvements. However, it could also be related to limited study power to assess such an effect or to the limited ability of the predefined kidney composite outcome (which was selected to examine kidney disease progression in the whole study population) to reflect, in a similarly objective manner, kidney disease progression in participants at this advanced disease stage over the specific time frame. This notion is supported by the fact that in a similar manner.

### Finerenone in the management of diabetes kidney disease [^116FPCEX]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

The impact of steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

In 1943, the role of mineralocorticoids in relation to damage to kidney and heart tissue was demonstrated, and in 1999, spironolactone was shown to reduce mortality by 30% in people with heart failure. This was followed by demonstration of a 15–24% mortality benefit post-myocardial infarction in people with mild heart failure treated with eplerenone in 2003 and 2011.

Finerenone is a selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), which is metabolized predominantly in the liver with minimal excretion via the kidneys. Due to its greater mineralocorticoid receptor affinity and selectivity, finerenone is associated with less hyperkalemia and minimal gynaecomastia compared with the steroidal MRAs. At a dose of 10 mg, finerenone has been shown to be equivalent to 25 to 50 mg of spironolactone in reducing Brain Natriuretic Polypeptide (BNP) and albuminuria, but with less hyperkalemia [5% versus 12%] in 372 subjects of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and CKD. In 2016, finerenone 10 to 20 mg was shown to be equivalent to 50 mg of eplerenone in reducing BNP > 30% from baseline with less incidence of potassium > 5 mmol/L [3.6% versus 4.7%].

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in diabetic kidney disease - mechanistic and therapeutic effects [^1174BXi6]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the leading complication in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therapies that limit CKD progression and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Despite the introduction of these therapeutics, an important residual risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular death remains in patients with T2D.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are a promising therapeutic option in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) due to the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in inflammatory cells, podocytes, fibroblasts, mesangial cells, and vascular cells. In preclinical studies, MRAs consistently reduce albuminuria, CKD progression, and activation of fibrotic and inflammatory pathways. DKD clinical studies have similarly demonstrated that steroidal MRAs lead to albuminuria reduction compared with placebo, although hyperkalaemia is a major secondary effect. Non-steroidal MRAs carry a lower risk of hyperkalaemia than steroidal MRAs, and the large FIDELIO-DKD clinical trial showed that the non-steroidal MRA finerenone also slowed CKD progression and reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo in patients with T2D. Encouragingly, other non-steroidal MRAs have anti-albuminuric properties in DKD. Whether combining MRAs with other renoprotective drugs, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, might provide additive protective effects warrants further investigation.

### Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone improves diastolic dysfunction in preclinical nondiabetic chronic kidney disease [^111drfnr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The mineralocorticoid receptor plays a significant role in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated cardiovascular complications. Classic steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are a therapeutic option, but their use in the clinic is limited due to the associated risk of hyperkalemia in patients with CKD. Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that has been recently investigated in two large phase III clinical trials (FIDELIO‐DKD [Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease] and FIGARO‐DKD [Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease]), showing reductions in kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: We tested whether finerenone improves renal and cardiac function in a preclinical nondiabetic CKD model. Twelve weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy, the rats showed classic signs of CKD characterized by a reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased kidney weight, associated with left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and decreased LV perfusion. These changes were associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activating phosphorylation (ser 1177). Treatment with finerenone prevented LV diastolic dysfunction and increased LV tissue perfusion associated with a reduction in cardiac fibrosis and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation. Curative treatment with finerenone improves nondiabetic CKD‐related LV diastolic function associated with a reduction in related complications.

### The role of finerenone in the management of diabetic nephropathy [^11623WgR]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. Even though mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) induce incremental reductions in urine albumin excretion when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, this combination is infrequently used because of an increased risk of hyperkalemia. In this context, finerenone, a novel selective MRA that appears to be associated with a lower risk for hyperkalemia compared with other MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone), might represent a useful tool in patients with DN. A recent large randomized trial suggested that finerenone delays the progression of DN and might also reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with DN. However, more data are needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of finerenone in this high-risk population.

### Diabetes educators: Understanding the role of finerenone in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112tCib8]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Finerenone has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials, namely FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, as well as in a prespecified pooled analysis of these trials known as the FIDELITY pooled analysis. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥ 30 mg/g), finerenone was demonstrated to reduce the risk of clinically significant kidney and cardiovascular (CV) events when used in conjunction with a maximally tolerated approved dose of a renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi), such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).

- **Clinical trials**
- **FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials**: These trials demonstrated the efficacy of finerenone in reducing significant kidney and CV events in patients with CKD associated with T2DM.
- **FIDELITY pooled analysis**: This analysis combined data from the FIDELIO and FIGARO trials.

Additional phase 3 clinical trials investigating the use of finerenone for other indications and patient populations are ongoing or have recently been completed. These studies continue to expand the understanding of finerenone's role in managing CKD associated with T2DM.

### Diabetes educators: Understanding the role of finerenone in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111PYb2C]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

Finerenone is the only non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) approved in the US to reduce the risk of sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

- **Mechanism of finerenone**: Finerenone selectively inhibits mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in the kidney and cardiovascular (CV) tissues. This decreases fibrosis, inflammation, and structural damage to these vital organ systems and ultimately reduces CV risk and CKD progression.

- **Comparison to steroidal MRAs**: Ns-MRAs like finerenone and steroidal MRAs such as spironolactone and eplerenone are both classified as aldosterone antagonists but have different mechanisms of action and indications for use. Notably, steroidal MRAs are not approved for use in treating CKD associated with T2DM.

The novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone has been shown to reduce the risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. In this issue of Kidney International, Bakris et al. present new data on the kidney efficacy of finerenone across subgroups of estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, as well as safety data. We attempt to place these results in context by discussing the benefits and risks of finerenone, as well as the generalizability of the study findings to routine care settings.

### Aldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptor activation, and CKD: A review of evolving treatment paradigms [^112QGcfy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation is involved in propagating kidney injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, and in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multiple clinical studies have defined the efficacy of MR antagonism in attenuating progressive kidney disease, and the US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone for this indication. In this review, we consider the basic science and clinical applicability of MR antagonism.

Because hyperkalemia constitutes a constraint to implementing evidence-based MR blockade, we review MRA-associated hyperkalemia in the context of finerenone and discuss evolving mitigation strategies to enhance the safety and efficacy of this treatment. Although the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD clinical trials focused solely on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we propose that MR activation and the resulting inflammation and fibrosis act as a substantive pathogenetic mediator not only in people with diabetic CKD but also in those with CKD without diabetes. We close by briefly discussing both recently initiated and future clinical trials that focus on extending the attributes of MR antagonism to a wider array of nondiabetic kidney disorders, such as patients with nonalbuminuric CKD.

### Finerenone in chronic kidney disease: A comprehensive review of mechanisms, efficacy and safety [^112eMdQM]. Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health issue that significantly impacts patients' quality of life and places a substantial burden on healthcare systems. Overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) plays a crucial role in kidney damage by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, and functional deterioration. Finerenone, a third-generation highly selective non-steroidal MR antagonist (MRA), has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for CKD.

In this review, we discuss the mechanisms through which MR overactivation contributes to renal damage, the structural and pharmacokinetic characteristics of finerenone, and compare it with first- and second-generation MRAs. We also focus on the safety and efficacy of finerenone in clinical applications for CKD. Notably, finerenone demonstrated a reduction in the risk of hyperkalemia during treatment, with its high selectivity minimizing treatment-related hormonal imbalances, offering a novel perspective. Furthermore, we explore the promising future of finerenone in both diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and non-diabetic CKD, presenting updates from recent clinical trials and new insights into its potential role in these populations.

In clinical practice, combining finerenone with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors has demonstrated strong cardiorenal protective effects. However, further clinical evidence is needed regarding direct combinations of finerenone with RAS inhibitors. Future studies on their synergistic effects may provide valuable insights.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111PULxU]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, specifically in patients with diabetes mellitus, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular benefits. This is advised for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 25 mL/min/1.73 m², normal serum potassium levels, and albuminuria greater than 30 mg/g despite being on the maximum tolerated dose of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor.

Recognize that nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are most appropriate for adult patients with T2DM who are at high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and cardiovascular events, as indicated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies.
