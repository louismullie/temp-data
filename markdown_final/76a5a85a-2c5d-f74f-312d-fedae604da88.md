## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code G72.3 in a patient with periodic paralysis and ventricular dysrhythmias?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by ICD-10 code G72.3 in a patient with periodic paralysis and ventricular dysrhythmias. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10 code structure and whether G72.3 maps to a specific named entity. Then, I should verify the clinical triad of periodic paralysis, ventricular arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features that defines Andersen-Tawil syndrome. Next, I will check guideline-based diagnostic criteria and the role of KCNJ2 testing. Finally, I will consider management implications and confirm the answer aligns with contemporary cardiology and neurology guidance.

> Let me first confirm the code mapping. ICD-10 code G72.3 corresponds to "Periodic paralysis", which is the umbrella category for inherited episodic muscle weakness disorders, including hypokalemic, hyperkalemic, and Andersen-Tawil syndromes, so G72.3 itself is not the specific syndrome name but the parent category that includes it [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical phenotype. The triad of episodic flaccid muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), ventricular arrhythmias, and distinctive skeletal dysmorphisms is classic for Andersen-Tawil syndrome, which is also described historically as Andersen syndrome or LQT7 within the long QT spectrum, with frequent premature ventricular complexes, polymorphic VT, and bidirectional VT on ECG, and a substantial proportion due to KCNJ2 mutations [^5c68d3e5] [^99b83841] [^2a47dedd].

> I should confirm the diagnostic framework. Contemporary ESC guidance advises suspecting Andersen-Tawil syndrome in patients without structural heart disease who have at least two of the following: prominent U waves with or without QT prolongation, bidirectional or polymorphic PVCs/VT, dysmorphic features, periodic paralysis, or a pathogenic KCNJ2 loss-of-function mutation, and recommends genetic testing when suspected, which fits this presentation of periodic paralysis plus ventricular dysrhythmias [^4f6caeb4] [^f72c99ef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought G72.3 might directly encode Andersen-Tawil syndrome, but that would be imprecise; G72.3 is the broader "Periodic paralysis" category, and Andersen-Tawil is the specific diagnosis within that category that best matches periodic paralysis coexisting with ventricular arrhythmias, so the most accurate statement is that G72.3 includes Andersen-Tawil syndrome as the likely entity here [^notfound].

> Next, I should review management implications to ensure clinical completeness. ESC guidance recommends ICD placement after aborted cardiac arrest or not-tolerated sustained VT in Andersen-Tawil syndrome, consideration of ICD for unexplained syncope or tolerated sustained VT, and consideration of beta-blockers and/or flecainide with or without acetazolamide for ventricular arrhythmia suppression, while also emphasizing coordinated neurology and cardiology care for attack management and surveillance [^e6a552d2] [^01f9dfd0] [^acffd9f5] [^9b9a08c0].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that the answer is precise. ICD-10 code G72.3 denotes Periodic paralysis; in a patient with periodic paralysis and ventricular dysrhythmias, the specific condition is Andersen-Tawil syndrome, which is the periodic paralysis subtype characterized by episodic weakness, ventricular arrhythmias, and often dysmorphic features, frequently due to KCNJ2 mutations, and diagnosed clinically with supportive genetic testing per contemporary guidelines [^4f6caeb4] [^f72c99ef] [^99b83841].

---

The ICD-10 code **G72.3** corresponds to **periodic paralysis**, a group of inherited channelopathies characterized by episodic muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis, often triggered by changes in serum potassium or other factors [^1cbdd7d8]. In patients with periodic paralysis and ventricular dysrhythmias, the most likely diagnosis is **Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)** [^4f6caeb4], a subtype of periodic paralysis caused by KCNJ2 mutations, featuring episodic weakness, prolonged QT interval, prominent U waves, and ventricular arrhythmias such as bidirectional or polymorphic VT [^99b83841] [^2a47dedd]. ATS is the only periodic paralysis subtype with a **cardiac phenotype**, so G72.3 with ventricular dysrhythmias strongly suggests ATS and warrants genetic testing and cardiology evaluation [^f72c99ef] [^4f6caeb4].

---

## Clinical features of periodic paralysis

Periodic paralysis comprises a group of **genetic disorders** characterized by episodic muscle weakness or flaccid paralysis, typically associated with alterations in serum potassium levels [^1cbdd7d8]. The three primary subtypes are:

- **Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP)**: Characterized by low potassium levels during attacks, often triggered by rest after exercise, high-carbohydrate meals, or stress [^1cbdd7d8].

- **Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP)**: Characterized by elevated potassium levels during attacks, often triggered by rest after exercise, fasting, or potassium intake [^defacec3].

- **Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)**: A distinct subtype characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features [^99b83841].

---

## ICD-10 code G72.3: clinical implications

The ICD-10 code **G72.3** specifically denotes periodic paralysis, encompassing all subtypes, including HypoPP, HyperPP, and ATS. The inclusion of ventricular dysrhythmias in the clinical presentation significantly narrows the differential diagnosis, as ATS is the only subtype of periodic paralysis consistently associated with cardiac arrhythmias [^4f6caeb4].

---

## Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)

ATS is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the **KCNJ2** gene, which encodes the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 [^2a47dedd]. This channel is critical for maintaining the resting membrane potential in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Mutations in KCNJ2 lead to destabilization of the resting membrane potential, resulting in episodic muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias [^1cbdd7d8].

---

### Clinical features of ATS

ATS is characterized by a **triad** of clinical features:

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Periodic paralysis | Episodic flaccid muscle weakness, often triggered by rest after exercise, stress, or fasting [^99b83841] |
| Cardiac arrhythmias | - Ventricular arrhythmias, including bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) <br/> - Polymorphic VT <br/> - Prolonged QT interval <br/> - Prominent U waves on ECG [^99b83841] [^4f6caeb4] |
| Dysmorphic features | - Low-set ears <br/> - Hypertelorism <br/> - Micrognathia <br/> - Fifth-digit clinodactyly <br/> - Syndactyly <br/> - Short stature <br/> - Scoliosis [^99b83841] |

---

### Pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias in ATS

The **cardiac arrhythmias** observed in ATS are primarily due to mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which disrupts the normal function of the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 [^2a47dedd]. This disruption leads to:

- **Prolonged action potential duration**: Resulting in prolonged QT intervals and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Early afterdepolarizations (EADs)**: Triggered activity that can initiate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, including torsades de pointes [^notfound].

- **Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia**: A hallmark arrhythmia of ATS, characterized by alternating QRS axis polarity [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

The diagnosis of ATS is established based on **clinical criteria**, supported by genetic testing and electrocardiographic findings. The following diagnostic criteria are commonly used:

- **Clinical triad**: Periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features [^99b83841].

- **Electrocardiographic abnormalities**: Prolonged QT interval, prominent U waves, and ventricular arrhythmias [^4f6caeb4].

- **Genetic testing**: Identification of pathogenic mutations in the KCNJ2 gene [^f72c99ef].

---

## Management strategies

Management of ATS requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, involving neurology, cardiology, and genetics:

- **Acute management of paralysis**: Correction of potassium levels, depending on whether the attack is hypokalemic or hyperkalemic [^584092aa].

- **Chronic management**: Acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide to prevent attacks of paralysis [^9b9a08c0].

- **Cardiac management**: Beta-blockers, flecainide, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement in patients with significant ventricular arrhythmias or syncope [^acffd9f5] [^e6a552d2].

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for affected individuals and their families to understand inheritance patterns and reproductive implications [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of ATS varies depending on the severity of **cardiac involvement**. While periodic paralysis episodes may be manageable, ventricular arrhythmias can pose significant risks, including sudden cardiac death. Early diagnosis, appropriate medical management, and regular cardiac monitoring are essential to improve outcomes [^9b9a08c0].

---

The ICD-10 code **G72.3** corresponds to periodic paralysis. In a patient with periodic paralysis and ventricular dysrhythmias, the most likely diagnosis is **Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)** [^4f6caeb4], a rare genetic disorder characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. ATS is caused by mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1, leading to destabilization of the resting membrane potential in skeletal and cardiac muscle [^2a47dedd]. Management of ATS requires a multidisciplinary approach, including acute and chronic management of paralysis, cardiac management, and genetic counseling [^9b9a08c0].

Validation of the LQTS diagnosis in Danish registries

To investigate the accuracy of the congenital LQTS ICD-10 code, we manually reviewed all charts of patients receiving a diagnosis of congenital LQTS (DI472E) at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark between November 2016 and March 2019. During this period, 123 patients with a DI472E diagnosis code were identified. After the manual review, we were able to verify the diagnosis in 120 out of 123 patients (positive predictive value = 97.6%).

Comorbidities

Comorbidities were defined based on hospital discharge diagnoses, including both in-hospital admissions and hospital outpatient clinic visits, coded according to the ICD-10 at any time before and after index.

Cardiovascular comorbidities in focus were acute myocardial infarction (I20, I23-I25), venous thromboembolism (I26, I82, I80, excluding I820, I800 and I808), peripheral vascular disease (I70, I74), and atrial fibrillation (I48).

Metabolic comorbidities in focus were diabetes mellitus with complications (E10-E14, excluding E109, E119, E129, E139), hypoglycaemia (E100E, E110B, E159, E159, E161, E162) and hypothyroidism (E03). To strengthen the diabetes diagnosis, claimed prescription on antidiabetic drugs and insulin were analysed separately as a proxy for diabetes.

We defined a variable covering any neurological diseases (G00-G99) and further stratification based on major ICD-10 subgroups; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (G00-G09), systemic atrophies primarily affecting the central nervous system (G10-14), extrapyramidal and movement disorders (G20-26), other degenerative disease and demyelinating diseases (G30-G37), episodic and paroxysmal disorders (G40-47), nerve and plexus disorders (G50-59), polyneuropathies (G60-64), disease of myoneural junction and muscle (G70-73), cerebral palsy (G80-83), other disorders of the nervous system (G90-99). In addition, a variable covering hearing loss (H912, H918, H932, H933) was added and for practical reasons listed under neurological disorders.

### Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis with KCNJ2 mutations: a novel mutation in the pore selectivity filter residue [^f9132d40]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis or Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes the distinct clinical features of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and facial and skeletal dysmorphisms and exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the human inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1, have been identified in the majority of cases. Despite well-established clinical and molecular characteristics, treatment is still case oriented, and timely diagnosis could be delayed because of the low incidence and phenotypic heterogeneity of this disease. This article describes the clinical and molecular features of 3 cases of Andersen-Tawil syndrome in 2 families. One of the mutations (G144D) was located in the pore selectivity filter residue (which is mutated recurrently) and was considered novel. Intermittent muscle weakness in childhood warrants careful evaluation of cardiac dysrhythmia and skeletal anomalies.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and complicated thyrotoxicosis, two presentations of hyperthyroidism with notable differences in their clinical manifestations: an experience from a tertiary care hospital in the United States [^c5a25443]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a muscular disorder characterized by sudden episodes of muscle weakness and hypokalemia in the setting of thyrotoxicosis. We aimed to report our experience with TPP in West Texas and compare its clinical presentation to that of patients admitted for complicated thyrotoxicosis.

Methods

Retrospective review of records of adult patients with admission diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, and/or discharge diagnosis of periodic paralysis seen at our institution in a 6-year period.

Results

Patients admitted for complicated thyrotoxicosis were more commonly females of a mean age of 44 years. Patients with TPP were more commonly Hispanic males of a mean age of 27 years. Despite no significantly different thyroid hormone levels, patients with TPP presented with less-severe signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as reflected by lower Burch-Wartofsky score on admission (19 vs. 35; P < .001) and lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the TPP group (0% vs. 36%; P < .001). Finally, 89% of TPP patients presented with corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, whereas only 19% of thyrotoxic patient presented with a prolonged QTc.

Conclusion

Hispanic patients with TTP seems to have relative resistance to the actions of thyroid hormones and commonly present with QTc prolongation, a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias.

### Characterization of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis: a survey of genetically diagnosed individuals [^1941388d]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Findings in our study that add to current knowledge or that counter scientific literature regarding hyperPP include the following points. Progressive myopathy affects approximately one-third of individuals regardless of the presence of concomitant myotonia. The RR of thyroid dysfunction in the study population is 3.6 compared to the general population; the trend toward an increased rate of cardiac arrhythmias in this population was not statistically significant.

A quarter of individuals experienced their sentinel attack in the second decade of life. Symptomatic myotonia was reported by 55.8% of the study population. Alcohol, changes in humidity, sleep, illness, medication, and menstruation can trigger attacks. Attacks may affect the facial and/or the respiratory muscles; some experience loss of urinary or fecal continence. A total of 12.4% of subjects reported severe symptoms between attacks that impair their activities of daily living. Individuals may experience permanent muscle weakness starting in childhood. Those with no chronic treatment regimen have a RR of 2.3 for reporting relatively poorer disease control than those taking long-term medications. During acute attacks, over 10% of individuals may note improvement with potassium intake. Consideration of these factors will allow physicians to develop appropriate and patient-specific management plans to best care for each affected individual.

Limitations of our study include recall bias, over- and under-reporting of symptoms, and the potential mischaracterization of myotonia relative to PMC. Furthermore, subjects' ability to generate unique responses implies that some of these responses would have been more widely reported if they had been included amongst the multiple choice options. While our study represents among the largest cohorts of genetically characterized hyperPP patients to be queried, 94 patients is still a relatively small number, especially given the possibility of genotype/phenotype subsets within what we know to be hyperPP.

Management of HyperPP

Acute Management

Acute management may include mild exercise at attack onset and a carbohydrate snack. Beta agonists can be an effective acute potassium‐lowering therapy for HyperPP. 1 In case reports, salbutamol 1–2 puffs (0.1 mg) and other beta‐agonists have shown benefits. 62, 63, 64 While severe hyperkalemia during attacks is typically not seen, the treatment for acute hyperkalemia which is severe or life‐threatening should match institutions' established protocols.

Prevention

In individuals with HyperPP, consider recommending consumption of multiple small carbohydrate snacks and avoid potassium‐rich foods. 10

Dichlorphenamide can be effective for chronic treatment and is approved for HyperPP. 22, 53 In randomized, placebo‐controlled studies, dichlorphenamide reduced attack frequency and severity among patients. 22, 53 The initial dose is 50 mg twice daily, which may be increased or decreased at weekly intervals based on individual response or the occurrence of adverse events. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg daily. 22, 53 Acetazolamide 125–1000 mg/day may be effective for chronic treatment of HyperPP. 15, 23

Thiazide diuretics are an option for chronic treatment of HyperPP. 1, 42 The drug of choice is hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg to 75 mg daily. 41, 54 Potassium‐sparing diuretics should be avoided.

There are no rigorously controlled data on the treatment of PMC, normokalemic PP, and other atypical PPs, but in general, the same treatment strategies used for HyperPP are appropriate.

Management of Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome

Management of individuals with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome requires the coordinated input of a neurologist familiar with the treatment of periodic paralysis and a cardiologist familiar with the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment for acute attacks of weakness or for chronic suppression of attacks of weakness in individuals with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome depends on whether the attack is associated with high or low levels of potassium, and treatment needs to be individualized for each patient (see sections above for HypoPP and HyperPP for specific recommendations). 10 Evaluations recommended to establish the extent of disease and needs in a patient diagnosed with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome are summarized in Table 6. 65 For asymptomatic patients with a KCNJ2 mutation, annual screening should include a 12‐lead ECG and 24‐h Holter monitoring.

### A retrospective study of accuracy and usefulness of electrophysiological exercise tests [^b4c591db]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

Two hundred fifty-nine patients were identified, and 256 included in the study (Table 1). Three patients were omitted. Two of them had scarce medical records, and one did not complete the electrophysiological exercise testing. Mean age at the time of exercise tests was 43.2 years (SD 12.8; range 11–78). 122 were male (47.7%) and 134 female (52.3%). There were more female (74.1%) than male in the case group. The mean age of the case group (36.9 years) was lower than the overall mean age of the study patients (43.3 years). The most common symptoms were muscle weakness, myalgia, cramps, and muscle stiffness.

Table 1
Characteristics of study patients

Cases comprised nondystrophic myotonias, periodic paralyses, myotonic dystrophy type 1, myotonic dystrophy type 2, and one case of myasthenic congenital myopathy which resulted from a well-known SCN4A variant

Acquired diagnoses

The most common clinical ICD-10 diagnoses were M79.1 Myalgia (n = 41), R29.8 Other and unspecific symptoms and signs involving the nervous and musculoskeletal system (n = 38), R25.2 Tendency for muscle cramping (n = 26), G72.9 Myopathy, unspecified (n = 24), and G72.8 Suspected metabolic myopathy (n = 22). These accounted for 59.0% of the diagnoses (Table 2). Most common after these were G71.18 Myotonia congenita (n = 10), G71.18 Paramyotonia congenita (n = 9), and G71.18 Suspected skeletal muscle channelopathy (n = 9). All patients of the case group were diagnosed with channelopathy, myotonic dystrophy type 1 or myotonic dystrophy type 2 (Tables 2 and 3). Diagnosis of suspected metabolic myopathy was based on symptoms and extensive investigations including electromyography, muscle biopsy, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination. Sixteen subjects also underwent non-ischaemic forearm exercise test and cycle ergometry. Pathogenic variants could be identified in one subject diagnosed with metabolic myopathy. He was homozygous for the POLG variant c.803G > C (p.G268A).

Clinical Presentation of Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome

Andersen‐Tawil syndrome is characterized by a triad of episodic flaccid muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), cardiac abnormalities (ventricular arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval, and prominent U waves), and distinctive skeletal features (low‐set ears, ocular hypertelorism, small mandible, fifth‐digit clinodactyly, syndactyly, short stature, scoliosis, and a broad forehead). 16, 24 This characteristic triad is present in 58–78% of patients with KCNJ2 mutations. 25, 26 Those affected typically present in the first or second decade with either cardiac symptoms (palpitations and/or syncope) or weakness that occurs spontaneously following prolonged rest or following rest after exertion. Permanent weakness is common. Attacks of muscle weakness can be associated with high, low or normal serum potassium levels. 16

Andersen‐Tawil syndrome is a potentially fatal condition. 27, 28, 29 In patients with the KCNJ2 gene mutation, ventricular arrhythmias are common (Table 1). 27, 28, 29 Cardiac manifestations of Andersen‐Tawil syndrome include premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), complex ventricular ectopy (bigeminy, consecutive PVCs, or multifocal PVCs), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and bidirectional VT. 29 Despite the common occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, syncope or cardiac arrest is rare. 27, 30 Early identification and diagnosis of these patients is important for treatment optimization.

### Hypokalemic periodic paralysis associated with malignant hyperthermia [^da8eaf3a]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is in most cases related to mutations within the dihydropyridine receptor gene. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia has been linked to a different part of the same gene, but is more frequently caused by mutations within the ryanodine receptor gene. We report the association of the two disorders in a patient for whom the most frequent mutations for hypokalemic periodic paralysis were not found. This suggests further genetic heterogeneity of this condition, the interest of this case residing in the known coupling between dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^50b2a44d]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Several symptoms or signs, or test results, can suggest an alternative diagnosis. 7, 38 The first attack most commonly occurs in the first 2 decades of life, and rarely after 30 years of age. Prominent sensory symptoms or pain or autonomic symptoms during the attacks may indicate Guillain‐Barré syndrome or spinal cord injury. Alteration of consciousness or abnormal movements may be indicative of seizure or stroke. Symptoms such as double vision, ptosis, or difficulty swallowing might point to a neuromuscular junction disorder. During the attacks, the motor exam should reveal a flaccid paralysis, so preservation of reflexes in a paralyzed limb should raise the possibility of a different cause. When interpreting genetic testing it is important to put the results in the clinical context. A known pathological mutation in the typical clinical context is confirmatory. Variants of unknown significance may require testing of additional family members, or further functional testing of the mutation in vitro to fully resolve its significance.

Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome

Andersen‐Tawil syndrome occurs with a high degree of phenotypic variability rendering diagnosis very difficult. Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene are identified in approximately 60% of all individuals with the disorder; a genetic mutation is not identified in the remaining 40% of cases where the cause is unknown. In those with KCNJ2 mutations, hyperkalemic episodes occur in approximately 15% of patients, normokalemic episodes in approximately 20% of patients, and the remainder have hypokalemic episodes of paralysis that are similar to those seen in HypoPP. 8

The presence of characteristic physical features and/or electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities is consistent with a diagnosis of Andersen‐Tawil syndrome. 18, 24 Typical resting ECG abnormalities include a long QTc or long QU interval in the absence of hypokalemia. When the diagnosis of Andersen‐Tawil syndrome is suspected, electrophysiological studies including the long exercise protocol may help support the diagnosis. 31, 39

The primary diagnostic criterion is documentation of the KCNJ2 mutation. In the absence of an identified genetic mutation, Andersen‐Tawil syndrome should be suspected in individuals with either A or B in Table 4. 24

### The primary periodic paralyses: diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment [^36242563]. Brain (2006). Low credibility.

Periodic paralyses (PPs) are rare inherited channelopathies that manifest as abnormal, often potassium (K)-sensitive, muscle membrane excitability leading to episodic flaccid paralysis. Hypokalaemic (HypoPP) and hyperkalaemic PP and Andersen-Tawil syndrome are genetically heterogeneous. Over the past decade mutations in genes encoding three ion channels, CACN1AS, SCN4A and KCNJ2, have been identified and account for at least 70% of the identified cases of PP and several allelic disorders. No prospective clinical studies have followed sufficiently large cohorts with characterized molecular lesions to draw precise conclusions. We summarize current knowledge of the clinical diagnosis, molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlations, pathophysiology and treatment in the PPs. We focus on unresolved issues including (i) Are there additional ion channel defects in cases without defined mutations? (ii) What is the mechanism for depolarization-induced weakness in Hypo PP? and finally (iii) Will detailed electrophysiological studies be able to correctly identify specific channel mutations? Understanding the pathophysiology of the potassium-sensitive PPs ought to reduce genetic complexity, allow subjects to be stratified during future clinical trials and increase the likelihood of observing true clinical effects. Ideally, therapy for the PPs will prevent attacks, avoid permanent weakness and improve quality of life. Moreover, understanding the skeletal muscle channelopathies will hopefully lead to insights into the more common central nervous system channel diseases such as migraine and epilepsy.

### Paroxysmal muscle weakness: the familial periodic paralyses [^9575cacc]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The familial periodic paralyses (PP) were commonly considered to be benign diseases since frequency and severity of the paralytic attacks decrease in adulthood. However, with increasing age, a third of the patients develop permanent weakness and muscle degeneration with fatty replacement. Another complication, cardiac arrhythmia, can result from the dyskalemia during paralytic attacks. The familial PP are typical dominant ion channelopathies: the function of the mutant muscular channel is compensated in the interictal state but defective under certain conditions which then cause flaccid weakness. A triggering factor is the level of serum potassium, the extracellular ion decisive for membrane excitability. In hyper- and hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the mutations are specifically located in the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels which are essential for action potential generation or excitation-contraction coupling. The common mechanism for the membrane inexcitability during paralytic attacks is a transient membrane depolarization that inactivates the sodium channels which are then no longer available for action potential generation. For the third PP type, the Andersen syndrome, the responsible gene is also expressed in cardiac muscle, and, independently of paralytic attacks, the hazard of ventricular arrhythmias is inherent. The gene product, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, is responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential, and all known mutations cause dominant-negative effects on the tetrameric channel complexes. In this article the clinical consequences of the mutations and the therapeutic strategies for all three types of PP are reported.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^7de16495]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

The diagnosis of PP can be confirmed by genetic testing, which we recommend as the first diagnostic step when there is an intermediate‐to‐high clinical suspicion. 31 All PPs are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Genetic testing identifies a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in 60% to 70% of patients meeting clinical criteria. 15, 17 For HypoPP, the gene is CACNA1S (Ca V.1) or SCN4A and the chromosome is 1q31‐32 or 17q23‐25; for HyperPP, the gene is SCN4A (Na V 1.4) and the chromosome is 17q23‐25; and for Andersen‐Tawil syndrome, the gene is KCNJ2 (Kir2.1) and the chromosome is 17q23. Several mutations have been associated with thyrotoxic HypoPP, most commonly KCNJ18, which may be seen in up to 3% of patients with HypoPP, 32 and KCNE3, which was originally associated with HypoPP, but whose association is currently controversial. 14 More recently mutations in the gene KCNJ5 have been implicated in one family with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome, and then subsequently found in 1/21 gene negative Andersen‐Tawil syndrome, but this will require verification in separate cohorts. 33

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Contemporary burden and correlates of symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^7d26289b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary data about symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) epidemiology are limited. We characterized prevalence and correlates of symptomatic PSVT within a large healthcare delivery system and estimated national PSVT burden.

Methods and Results

We identified adults with an encounter for potential PSVT between 2010 and 2015 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, excluding those with prior known atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. We adjudicated medical records, ECGs, and other monitoring data to estimate positive predictive values for targeted International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th and 10th Revisions codes in inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient settings. Combinations of diagnosis codes and settings were used to calculate PSVT prevalence, and PSVT correlates were identified using multivariable regression. We estimated national rates by applying prevalence estimates in Kaiser Permanente to 2010 US Census data. The highest positive predictive values included codes for "PSVT" in the emergency department (82%), "unspecified cardiac dysrhythmia" in the emergency department (27%), "anomalous atrioventricular excitation" as a primary inpatient diagnosis (33%), and "unspecified paroxysmal tachycardia" as a primary inpatient diagnosis (23%). Prevalence of symptomatic PSVT was 140 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, 100–179) and was higher for individuals who were older, women, white or black, or who had valvular heart disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, or prior bleeding. We estimate the national prevalence of symptomatic PSVT to be 168 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, 120–215).

Conclusions

Selected diagnostic codes in inpatient and emergency department settings may be useful to identify symptomatic PSVT episodes. We project that at least 0.168% of US adults experience symptomatic PSVT, and certain characteristics can identify people at higher risk.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^584092aa]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Acute management

Mild exercise (e.g. nonresistance activities such as walking around a room or shaking the arms) at the onset of the attack may be of benefit. Low serum potassium is not due to low total body potassium but rather shifts of potassium from the blood compartment into the intracellular muscle compartment. Therefore, correction of serum potassium should not be undertaken with the goal of correcting low total body potassium. Treatment options include oral or intravenous (IV) potassium administration. 18, 19 Oral potassium is recommended for outpatient treatment. Slow‐release formulations usually should be avoided for acute management. The dose of oral potassium is 0.2–0.4 mEq/kg every 30 min not to exceed 200–250 mEq/day. Administering potassium by IV infusion usually requires hospitalization for ECG monitoring but is only necessary if the patient cannot take oral potassium. The dose of IV potassium is 40 mEq/L in 5% mannitol solution infused at a maximum of 20 mEq/h, not to exceed 200 mEq/day. A potassium chloride IV bolus of 5 mEq can be used as an alternative. Use of glucose‐ and saline‐containing IV solutions for administering potassium should be avoided, as this may worsen muscle weakness. 55

### Characterization of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis: a survey of genetically diagnosed individuals [^6ece1451]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and symptoms

Participants reported their age of first attack as shown in Fig. 1. Twenty-five percent experienced their sentinel attack in the second decade of life, in contrast to the accepted notion that attacks usually begin in the first decade of life.

Fig. 1
Individuals reported the age at which they experienced their first attack. Sentinel attacks were reported as late as age 19, with 25% of subjects reporting their first attack at age 10 or older (No. number)

The average diagnostic journey for our cohort from the time of the first onset of symptoms until reaching the correct diagnosis lasted 19.4 years, ranging from an immediate diagnosis due to diagnosed relatives to as long as 65 years. Study participants saw an average of 4 health care professionals, some seeing as many as 10, before obtaining their correct diagnosis. The majority of participants regarded neurologists as the most valuable physicians in reaching their proper diagnosis; several considered either a geneticist or pediatrician as most valuable. Subjects reported undergoing a range of diagnostic studies, most commonly undergoing blood tests, EMGs, and electrocardiograms (EKGs). Surprisingly, 23.4% of the study population underwent potassium challenges tests, which put them at risk for a severe attack. Before arriving at a diagnosis of hyperPP, subjects were misdiagnosed with conditions such as malingering, conversion disorder, hypoPP, myotonia congenita, and depression. A significant number of these misdiagnoses are psychiatric conditions. Generalizing from this cohort, unless recognized quickly due to family history, the path from attack onset to proper diagnosis is a long one, often taking years, involving a multitude of diagnostic studies and misdiagnoses, and ultimately necessitating a neurologist to clinch the diagnosis.

### Routinely collected health data to study inherited heart disease: a systematic review (2000–2016) [^cca8c884]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of inherited heart disease using routinely collected health data

Seven of the 12 inherited heart diseases included in our search strategy were defined in at least one study (table 2). All studies specified ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes to define an inherited heart disease population; three studies also used procedure codes. Across all 12 studies, there were 17 definitions of inherited heart disease. Of these, nine definitions were used in at least two studies or conditions.

Table 2
Definitions of identifying inherited heart disease using routinely collected health data

Marfan syndrome

Two of the seven Marfan syndrome studies did not further detail relevant ICD-9 code(s). The remaining five studies had a consistent definition of Marfan syndrome based on the coding system used by the routinely collected data source. Specifically, the two German studies used the ICD-10-GM (German Modification) diagnosis code Q87.4, given as either an in-hospital diagnosis or two outpatient diagnoses within 6 months. The three studies using ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) all used the diagnosis code 759.82. One of these studies required the diagnosis code to be either the primary or secondary diagnosis.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Four of the five hypertrophic cardiomyopathy studies used the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 425.1 to identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; one study used the ICD-9-CM code of 425.18. Two of the five studies used the ICD diagnosis code alone to identify patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The other three studies required the patient to have a procedure code for a septal myectomy, septal ablation or alcohol septal ablation, in addition to the ICD diagnosis code of 425.1. One of these three studies also required the ICD diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to be the primary diagnosis.

Other inherited heart diseases

One study defined six inherited heart diseases using ICD-9 diagnosis codes. In addition to HCM, these conditions include Brugada syndrome (ICD-9 code of 746.89), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (427.1) and long QT syndrome (426.82). Despite left ventricular non-compaction and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy being distinct diseases, both were identified using one ICD-9 code (425.4).

### Novel KCNJ2 mutation in familial periodic paralysis with ventricular dysrhythmia [^2a47dedd]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which codes cardiac and skeletal inward rectifying K+ channels (Kir2.1), produce Andersen's syndrome, which is characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and dysmorphic features.

Methods and Results

In 3 Japanese family members with periodic paralysis, ventricular arrhythmias, and marked QT prolongation, polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism/DNA sequencing identified a novel, heterozygous, missense mutation in KCNJ2, Thr192Ala (T192A), which was located in the putative cytoplasmic chain after the second transmembrane region M2. Using the Xenopus oocyte expression system, we found that the T192A mutant was nonfunctional in the homomeric condition. Coinjection with the wild-type gene reduced the current amplitude, showing a weak dominant-negative effect.

Conclusions

T192, which is located in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site and also the region necessary for Kir2.1 multimerization, is a highly conserved amino acid residue among inward-rectifier channels. We suggest that the T192A mutation resulted in the observed electrical phenotype.

Most individuals with primary PP have inherited autosomal dominant disorders; sporadic cases also occur, although the frequency is unknown. 10 While all of the familial disorders can be attributed to genetic mutations in muscle ion channels, they differ in their genetics, signs and symptoms, and treatment.

HypoPP is associated with mutations in calcium channel (CACNA1S; 60% of kindreds) and sodium channel (SCN4A; 20% of kindreds) genes. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The clinical presentation is identical for patients with HypoPP caused by calcium or sodium channel mutations because homologous gene defects of either channel cause an anomalous leakage current, which is active at the resting potential and produces susceptibility to paradoxical depolarization of the fiber and inexcitability in the setting of low extracellular K + (2.5 to 3.5 Meq/L). 1, 12

HyperPP is associated with mutations in the sodium channel (SCN4A) gene on chromosome 17q23. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 These mutations are associated with gain of function changes, usually from impaired channel inactivation or occasionally from enhanced activation.

Andersen‐Tawil syndrome in some cases is caused by mutations of the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1, stabilizing resting potential of skeletal muscle and cardiac myocytes. 8 Unlike HypoPP and HyperPP, which are limited to mutations in channels expressed almost exclusively in skeletal muscle, the potassium channel mutations leading to Andersen‐Tawil syndrome affect multiple tissues, and are associated with a highly variable phenotype of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and distinctive facial and skeletal anomalies. 2, 16

Study population

For the COVID-19 cohort, we included patients 21 years of age or above who had one or more medical service visits with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code U07.1; in any setting) between April 2020 and June 2021. Two comparator cohorts (pandemic and pre pandemic) involving patients 21 years of age or greater with at least one medical service visit with a primary diagnosis of AURI (pandemic (between April 2020 and June 2021) or pre pandemic (between January 2018 and December 2018)) were also created. An AURI diagnosis was defined as any of the following ICD-10-CM codes: J00, J01, J010, J0100, J0101, J011, J0110, J0111, J012, J0120, J0121, J013, J0130, J0131, J014, J0140, J0141, J018, J0180, J0181, J019, J0190, J0191, J02, J020, J028, J029, J03, J030, J0300, J0301, J038, J0380, J0381, J039, J0390, J0391, J04, J040, J041, J0410, J0411, J042, J043, J0430, J0431, J05, J050, J051, J0510, J0511, J06, J060, J069. The initial COVID-19 (for the COVID-19 cohort) or AURI diagnosis (for AURI pandemic/prepandemic cohorts) date was considered as the index date. Consistent across all cohorts, patients were excluded if there was a record of them having any of the following in the pre index period: COVID-19, AURI, prior AF diagnosis, an antiarrhythmic prescription drug claim or a catheter ablation procedure. For all three cohorts, continuous enrolment was required throughout the 12-month pre index and post index period. For the AURI pandemic cohort, an additional exclusion criterion was record of a COVID-19 diagnosis in the entire study period.

2 Methods

2.1 Population and Study Setting

We used the CDC WONDER database to collect information from death certificates. This study, covering the years 1999 to 2023, analyzed arrhythmia‐related deaths. The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (ICD‐10), diagnostic codes I44.0(I44.1, I44.2, I44.3, I44.4, I44.5, I44.6, I44.7), I45.0(I45.1, I45.2, I45.3, I45.4, I45.5, I45.6, I45.8, I45.9), I47.0(I47.1, I47.2, I47.9), I48.0, and I49.0(I49.1, I49.2, I49.3, I49.4, I49.5, I49.8, I49.9) were utilized in the study. These codes or conditions are referred to as arrhythmia by previous studies. The data includes mortality records from all fifty states and the District of Columbia, detailing the specific causes of death listed on the certificates. Patients in this study were defined as individuals aged 35 to more than 85 years at the time of their death. In addition, sensitivity analysis as the underlying cause of death in the background of arrhythmia‐related cardiovascular disease was also carried out by using code (I00‐I99). No regional institutional review board approval was required since the study used government‐issued deidentified public use data. This study complied with STROBE guidelines for reporting observational research.

### Association of arrhythmia-related genetic variants with phenotypes documented in electronic medical records [^e0f575e8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Large-scale DNA sequencing identifies incidental rare variants in established Mendelian disease genes, but the frequency of related clinical phenotypes in unselected patient populations is not well established. Phenotype data from electronic medical records (EMRs) may provide a resource to assess the clinical relevance of rare variants.

Objective

To determine the clinical phenotypes from EMRs for individuals with variants designated as pathogenic by expert review in arrhythmia susceptibility genes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study included 2022 individuals recruited for nonantiarrhythmic drug exposure phenotypes from October 5, 2012, to September 30, 2013, for the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network Pharmacogenomics project from 7 US academic medical centers. Variants in SCN5A and KCNH2, disease genes for long QT and Brugada syndromes, were assessed for potential pathogenicity by 3 laboratories with ion channel expertise and by comparison with the ClinVar database. Relevant phenotypes were determined from EMRs, with data available from 2002 (or earlier for some sites) through September 10, 2014.

Exposures

One or more variants designated as pathogenic in SCN5A or KCNH2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Arrhythmia or electrocardiographic (ECG) phenotypes defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, ECG data, and manual EMR review.

Results

Among 2022 study participants (median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 56–65 years]; 1118 [55%] female; 1491 [74%] white), a total of 122 rare (minor allele frequency < 0.5%) nonsynonymous and splice-site variants in 2 arrhythmia susceptibility genes were identified in 223 individuals (11% of the study cohort). Forty-two variants in 63 participants were designated potentially pathogenic by at least 1 laboratory or ClinVar, with low concordance across laboratories (Cohen κ = 0.26). An ICD-9 code for arrhythmia was found in 11 of 63 (17%) variant carriers vs 264 of 1959 (13%) of those without variants (difference, +4%; 95% CI, -5% to +13%; P = 0.35). In the 1270 (63%) with ECGs, corrected QT intervals were not different in variant carriers vs those without (median, 429 vs 439 milliseconds; difference, -10 milliseconds; 95% CI, -16 to +3 milliseconds; P = 0.17). After manual review, 22 of 63 participants (35%) with designated variants had any ECG or arrhythmia phenotype, and only 2 had corrected QT interval longer than 500 milliseconds.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among laboratories experienced in genetic testing for cardiac arrhythmia disorders, there was low concordance in designating SCN5A and KCNH2 variants as pathogenic. In an unselected population, the putatively pathogenic genetic variants were not associated with an abnormal phenotype. These findings raise questions about the implications of notifying patients of incidental genetic findings.

### Accuracy of diagnostic codes for identifying brief resolved unexplained events [^96f448f8]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding strategies for the identification of patients with a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged < 1 year with an emergency department (ED) visit between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018, and an ICD-10 code for the following: (1) BRUE; (2) characteristics of BRUE; (3) serious underlying diagnoses presenting as a BRUE; and (4) nonserious diagnoses presenting as a BRUE. Sixteen algorithms were developed by using various combinations of these 4 groups of ICD-10 codes. Manual chart review was used to assess the performance of these ICD-10 algorithms for the identification of (1) patients presenting to an ED who met the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical definition for a BRUE and (2) the subset of these patients discharged from the ED or hospital without an explanation for the BRUE.

Results

Of 4512 records reviewed, 1646 (36.5%) of these patients met the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for BRUE on ED presentation, 1016 (61.7%) were hospitalized, and 959 (58.3%) had no explanation on discharge. Among ED discharges, the BRUE ICD-10 code alone was optimal for case ascertainment (sensitivity: 89.8% to 92.8%; positive predictive value: 51.7% to 72.0%). For hospitalized patients, ICD-10 codes related to the clinical characteristics of BRUE are preferred (specificity 93.2%, positive predictive value 32.7% to 46.3%).

Conclusions

The BRUE ICD-10 code and/or the diagnostic codes for the characteristics of BRUE are recommended, but the choice between approaches depends on the investigative purpose and the specific BRUE population and setting of interest.

### HRS / ACC / AHA expert consensus statement on the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients who are not included or not well represented in clinical trials [^b04ace2b]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy less than 9 months — time-based ICD guidance states: For non-ischemic cardiomyopathy < 3 months, ICD Not recommended. For non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 3–9 months with LVEF ≤ 35% and unlikely to recover, ICD can be useful; ICD implantation for primary prevention between 3 and 9 months can be useful in selected patients with NICM who are unlikely to have recovery of left ventricular function. In patients with NICM < 9 months it is generally prudent to delay ICD until the full effect of medical therapy can be evaluated.

### Temporal trends in characteristics and outcomes associated with in-hospital cardiac arrest: a 20-year analysis (1999–2018) [^79ce9bd3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Despite advances in resuscitation medicine, the burden of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remains substantial. The impact of these advances and changes in resuscitation guidelines on IHCA survival remains poorly defined. To better characterize evolving patient characteristics and temporal trends in the nature and outcomes of IHCA, we undertook a 20-year analysis of a national database. Methods and Results We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (1999–2018) using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) codes to identify all adult patients suffering IHCA. Subgroup analysis was performed based on the type of cardiac arrest (ie, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or pulseless electrical activity-asystole). An age- and sex-adjusted model and a multivariable risk-adjusted model were used to adjust for potential confounders. Over the 20-year study period, a steady increase in rates of IHCA was observed, predominantly driven by pulseless electrical activity-asystole arrest. Overall, survival rates increased by over 10% after adjusting for risk factors. In recent years (2014–2018), a similar trend toward improved survival is noted, though this only achieved statistical significance in the pulseless electrical activity-asystole cohort. Conclusions Though the ideal quality metric in IHCA is meaningful neurological recovery, survival is the first step toward this. As overall IHCA rates rise, overall survival rates are improving in tandem. However, in more recent years, these improvements have plateaued, especially in the realm of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation-related survival. Future work is needed to better identify characteristics of IHCA nonsurvivors to improve resource allocation and health care policy in this area.

### HRS / ACC / AHA expert consensus statement on the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients who are not included or not well represented in clinical trials [^eb111829]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Benefits of dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) — Dual-chamber devices can provide atrial pacing for sinus node dysfunction or other needs for atrial and/or dual-chamber pacing; in registry data, less than 5% of ICD implants were for second- or third-degree atrioventricular block and 12% were for bradycardic arrests. Use cases include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myotonic dystrophy, cardiac sarcoidosis, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, and long QT syndrome, and atrial or dual-chamber pacing receives a Class I recommendation for patients with long QT syndrome. Initial placement of an atrial lead may reduce the likelihood and morbidity of a future upgrade if sinus node dysfunction develops, and it enables dual-chamber discrimination algorithms and clearer interpretation of electrograms, including demonstration of ventriculoatrial dissociation during sustained monomorphic VT.

### An international, multicentered, evidence-based reappraisal of genes reported to cause congenital long QT syndrome [^79184644]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Genes Associated With Multiorgan Syndromes Including QT Prolongation

Andersen-Tawil syndrome (KCNJ2) and Timothy syndrome (CACNA1C) are rare conditions affecting multiple systems whose phenotypic expression includes QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. In Andersen-Tawil syndrome, extracardiac manifestations include dysmorphic features and periodic paralysis with hypo- and hyperkalemic episodes in some patients. The cardiac manifestation includes QT-U abnormalities but not typical QT prolongation. Ventricular arrhythmias also differ from typical LQTS with frequent premature ventricular complexes and polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia but only rarely torsades de pointes. In Timothy syndrome, multiple systems may be involved, including dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, endocrine abnormalities, and congenital heart defects. Electrophysiological abnormalities include bradycardia, atrioventricular block, QT prolongation, and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias.

The rationale behind using these genes as candidates in LQTS in reported studies relied on precedent in which some multiple-organ syndromes may present with a cardiac-specific phenotype in isolation (eg, Fabry disease). Nevertheless, the Working Group found only limited evidence for KCNJ2 as a disease-causing gene in isolated LQTS. Although curator teams and the Working Group agreed that CACNA1C had some evidence to support its possible role as a cause of isolated LQTS, the limited published human genetic data at the present time resulted in a consensus for this gene as having moderate-level evidence for isolated LQTS. As such, extra care should be utilized before classifying variants in these genes as pathogenic when found in cases suspicious of LQTS.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation — management and outcomes — Management is empirical and "most patients are advised to undergo an ICD implant" (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). In a small series, "at 2.8 years of follow-up only 1/ 10 patients had a recurrence of VT but none experienced ICD shock or death." A multicenter experience described "26 IVF patients" evaluated with programmed electrical stimulation with VF inducibility in "81% of inducible patients," and "At follow-up ranging between 14 and 216 months no VF or fatalities occurred." Longer-term data include "a 43% recurrent event rate" in "37 IVF patients (77 ± 41 months)," and in a series where patients "underwent catheterization and ablation of Purkinje potentials" initiating VPBs, "By far the majority (36/38) were free of VF at 52 months of follow-up."

### Characterization of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis: a survey of genetically diagnosed individuals [^defacec3]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hyperPP is based on clinical grounds, sometimes with the use of provocative tests in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. The diagnosis is suggested by a history of attacks of weakness or paralysis, a positive family history, and the presence of myotonia or paramyotonia. Serum creatine kinase (CK) values may be elevated, and some individuals exhibit calf hypertrophy. The muscles are typically well-developed; however, a large proportion of individuals with hyperPP develop a chronic progressive proximal myopathy as they age. Parenthetically, individuals without interictal myotonia are much more susceptible to developing this progressive myopathy than are individuals with myotonia. Muscle biopsy is non-specific, though will frequently reveal muscle fiber atrophy with vacuoles. Genetic testing is positive in approximately 60% of individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria. An EMG may show myotonic signs, which strongly support the diagnosis, although approximately half of those with the most common mutation show no such signs. Provocative tests, such as the potassium challenge test, pose obvious risks to the patient but may be done to support the diagnosis. The availability of genetic testing and electrophysiologic studies largely obviates the need for such dangerous tests.

Prophylactic measures include eating frequent carbohydrate-rich meals and the continuous use of diuretics that reduce serum potassium levels, such thiazides or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Equally important is avoidance of potassium-rich foods, medications that raise serum potassium, fasting, strenuous work, and exposure to cold. Mexiletine is beneficial in the management of myotonia. Early in the course of an attack, abortive or attenuating measures include mild exercise, carbohydrate ingestion, and beta-adrenergic agonist inhalation. Severe attacks warrant treatment with intravenous glucose and insulin. Calcium carbonate is used in cases of severe hyperkalemia to stabilize the myocardium to prevent arrhythmia. Patients with hyperPP must avoid depolarizing anesthetics, such as suxamethonium and anticholinesterase agents, as they aggravate myotonia and can interfere with intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The present study describes the collective experience of a relatively large cohort of individuals genetically diagnosed with hyperPP. Study objectives include to confirm or refute previously reported descriptions of the disease, to discover new and previously unreported features and associations, and to provide a better understanding of the experience of patients with hyperPP.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 5 definitions — commonly used terms in ventricular arrhythmia care and sudden cardiac death — define ventricular tachycardia (VT) as a cardiac arrhythmia of ≥ 3 consecutive complexes originating in the ventricles at a rate > 100 bpm (cycle length: < 600 ms), with sustained VT defined as VT > 30 s or requiring termination due to hemodynamic compromise in < 30 s and nonsustained VT as ≥ 3 beats, terminating spontaneously; torsades de pointes is polymorphic VT that occurs in the setting of a long QT interval; ventricular flutter is a regular ventricular arrhythmia (VA) > 300 bpm (cycle length: 200 ms) with a sinusoidal, monomorphic appearance and no isoelectric interval between successive QRS complexes; ventricular fibrillation (VF) is rapid, grossly irregular electrical activity with marked variability in electrocardiographic waveform, with ventricular rate usually > 300 bpm (cycle length: < 200 ms); sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity such that the victim becomes unresponsive, with either persisting gasping respirations or absence of any respiratory movements, and no signs of circulation as manifest by the absence of a perceptible pulse; sudden cardiac death (SCD) is sudden and unexpected death occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms, or occurring in patients found dead within 24 h of being asymptomatic and presumably due to a cardiac arrhythmia or hemodynamic catastrophe; VT/VF storm refers to a state of cardiac electrical instability that is defined by ≥ 3 episodes of sustained VT, VF, or appropriate shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) within 24 h; primary prevention ICD is ICD placement with the intention of preventing SCD in a patient who has not had sustained VT or SCA but who is at an increased risk for these events, whereas secondary prevention ICD is ICD placement in a patient with prior SCA, sustained VT, or syncope caused by VA; structural heart disease encompasses ischemic heart disease (IHD), all types of cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and adult congenital heart disease; and a cardiac channelopathy is an arrhythmogenic disease due to a genetic abnormality that results in dysfunction of a cardiac ion channel (eg, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT).

### Long QT syndrome is associated with an increased burden of diabetes, psychiatric and neurological comorbidities: a nationwide cohort study [^a910e074]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and registries

This study was a retrospective, nationwide cohort study based on data from nationwide Danish registries, including the Danish National Prescription Registry, the National Population Register, and the Danish National Patient Register. By use of the unique social security number, given to all citizens on birth or immigration, we were able to link data from several registries at the individual level. Denmark has a freely available, tax-financed, public healthcare system for all citizens irrespective of income and social class. Only two per cent of healthcare activities are managed in private hospitals, and the demands for reporting to the central registries are the same as in the public hospital setting. Data on in-hospital diagnosis and procedures are consistently reported to the Danish National Patient Register on hospital discharge and following consultations in the outpatient clinic. This setup ensures a complete record of registered healthcare activities. Date of death is continuously reported to the National Population Register ensuring complete follow-up on vital status. All prescriptions dispensed from Danish pharmacies are collected in the Danish National Prescription Registry due to partial government reimbursement, which has been shown to accurately reflect patient's history of filled prescriptions. The registries have been described in further detail elsewhere.

Records were deidentified by central authorities prior to our analysis; names and addresses were removed, and social security numbers were encrypted. Efforts were made not to report data that may aid in the identification of individuals. Hence, Danish law prohibits reporting of low group numbers (n < 3), which were replaced with 'na' throughout the paper or omitted entirely. The exact numbers are known to the investigators. Our study period went from 2003 until June 2017.

Identification of LQTS population and matched controls

We identified all patients diagnosed for the first time with congenital LQTS based on the WHO International Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) DI472E code received in hospital or in an outpatient clinic. Patients were characterised and followed from the date of first diagnosis, henceforth referred to as index. If patients with congenital LQTS at index later received a diagnosis of acquired LQTS (DI472F), the patients were excluded from the analyses. Each LQTS patient was matched with five controls, forming the control group.

HRS/ACC/AHA consensus — nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) within 9 months of initial diagnosis and need for permanent pacing: In patients < 9 months from the initial diagnosis of NICM who require nonelective permanent pacing, who would meet primary prevention criteria for implantation of an ICD, and recovery of left ventricular function is uncertain or not expected, implantation of an ICD with the appropriately selected pacing abilities is recommended. Implantation of an ICD is not recommended within the first 3 months after the initial diagnosis of NICM unless other potential reasons for ICD implant are present, and in patients with NICM < 9 months it is generally prudent to delay ICD until the full effect of medical therapy can be evaluated. This approach reflects that the data suggest that a significant proportion of patients with the new diagnosis of NICM will have improvement in left ventricular function, but some patients will remain at risk of ventricular arrhythmias.

2.2 Study population

We queried the NIS data set from January 2002 to December 2018 to identify all patients aged ≥ 18 years old with primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD‐9) and International Classification of Diseases, tenth Edition (ICD‐10) diagnosis codes for VT who also had a secondary diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The list of ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 Clinical Modification (CM) and Procedure Coding System (PCS) codes used to define the inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Supporting Information: Data S1. Patients aged < 18 years old and those with a secondary diagnosis of "other specific conduction disorders," supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, "other premature beats," cardiac dysrhythmia, Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome, Lown‐Ganong‐Levine syndrome, ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, prior myocardial infarction (MI), prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and prior coronary artery bypass grafting were excluded. Patients who received CA were identified using the ICD‐9 and ICD‐10‐PCS codes. Patients with either of the following cardiac procedures during the index hospitalization were excluded to avoid attributing their complications to the CA procedure as described in Figure 1; (1) permanent pacemaker implantation, (2) implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, (3) transvenous lead removal, or (4) open surgical ablation. The cohort was further stratified into two study groups: CA procedure versus medically managed for VT. Similar methods were used in prior studies to identify patients with CS and patients undergoing CA procedure for VT from large administrative databases. Of note, ICD‐10‐CM and ICD‐10‐PCS coding were introduced in the last quarter of 2015. Hence, ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐9‐PCS codes were used for the year 2002 — the first 3 quarters of 2015 and ICD‐10‐CM and ICD‐10‐PCS for the remaining years.

ICD implantation < 9 months from the initial diagnosis of nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM): For patients < 9 months from the initial diagnosis of NICM who have significant left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure symptoms, implantation of an ICD for primary prevention is not recommended within the first 3 months after initial diagnosis of NICM, and if recovery of left ventricular function is unlikely, implantation of an ICD for primary prevention can be useful between 3 and 9 months after initial diagnosis of NICM.

Methods

This study was approved by the Queen Square Research Ethics Committee, London, UK (09/H0716/76).

Ascertainment of Whole Exome Sequencing Data and Cohort Phenotypic Groups

In total, 11,424 DNA samples, extracted from blood, which had undergone WES analysis at the University College London Queen Square Genomics Facility between 2011 and 2019, were included in the study. The cohort was composed of probands with a range of neurological phenotypes, their relatives, and healthy controls. The most common clinical group comprised extrapyramidal and movement disorders (International Classification of Disease‐10 code G20–G26; 31.5%), followed by systemic atrophies, primarily affecting the central nervous system (G10–G14; 17%), episodic and paroxysmal disorders (G40–G47; 16.4%), diseases of myoneural junction and muscle (G70–G73; 7.5%), other degenerative diseases of the nervous system (G30–G32; 7.4%), polyneuropathies and other disorders of the peripheral nervous system (G60–G64; 3.6%), and mitochondrial metabolism disorders (E88.4; 1.4%). Neurologically normal controls accounted for 15.2% of the exomes.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^1f8f6cd0]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Primary electrical diseases — syncope significance and ICD considerations: Unexplained syncope is regarded as an ominous finding in inherited cardiac ion channel abnormalities, and an ICD should be carefully considered in the absence of another competing diagnosis or when ventricular tachyarrhythmia cannot be excluded as a cause of syncope; however, syncope does not necessarily carry a high risk of major life-threatening cardiac events. In long QT syndrome, especially those with LQT2 and LQT3, the number of cardiac events before the age of 18 years, very prolonged QT intervals, and female gender predict a worse outcome, and Brugada syndrome patients with a spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern have a worse outcome than those with a type 2 or drug-induced pattern. In the largest multicentre Brugada series with ICDs, in 220 patients including 118 (88%) with a history of cardiac arrest and 88 (40%) with a history of syncope, the rates of appropriate ICD shocks were 22 and 10%, respectively, during a mean follow-up period of 38 ± 27 months.

### HRS / ACC / AHA expert consensus statement on the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients who are not included or not well represented in clinical trials [^e4228399]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

HRS/ACC/AHA ICD therapy — potential benefits and supporting evidence for adding an atrial lead/dual-chamber selection: Dual-chamber devices can provide atrial pacing to patients with sinus node dysfunction or other pacing needs, and in the NCDR ICD database less than 5% of implants were for second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and 12% for bradycardia arrest. Atrial or dual-chamber pacing can be useful in selected patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myotonic dystrophy, cardiac sarcoidosis, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, and long QT syndrome, and receives a Class I recommendation for patients with long QT syndrome; initial placement of an atrial lead will reduce the likelihood and associated morbidity of a future upgrade procedure if sinus node dysfunction develops and allows use of dual-chamber arrhythmia discrimination algorithms. Rigorous studies have had mixed results regarding discrimination or inappropriate therapy reduction, a decision analysis in most patients favored dual-chamber selection but assumed no increased risk from the atrial lead, and no randomized trial has clearly demonstrated a superiority of dual-chamber devices in terms of inappropriate shocks, hospitalizations, or mortality.

### 2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^26c253b0]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) — endpoint and arrhythmia definitions used for risk assessment specify that appropriate therapies for VT, ventricular flutter (VFL), and VF are included as endpoints and that ICD-treated arrhythmias are used as a surrogate for sudden cardiac death (SCD) though not all ICD-treated arrhythmias would have led to SCD. Life-threatening arrhythmias are generally defined as SCD or hypotensive VT in patients without ICDs and ICD-treated VF or VFL ≥ 240 bpm in those with ICDs, whereas all arrhythmias are generally defined as any sustained arrhythmia (> 30 seconds) that spontaneously occurs and any ventricular arrhythmia treated by the ICD, including antitachycardia pacing or shock.
