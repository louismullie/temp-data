## Question

What level of spinal cord injury can cause autonomic dysreflexia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what level of spinal cord injury can cause autonomic dysreflexia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy of descending sympathetic control and the splanchnic outflow to identify the plausible anatomical cutoff. Then, I should verify the best prospective evidence that quantifies risk by neurological level. Next, I will check for corroboration across trials and guideline-type statements. After that, I need to stratify risk by lesion height and consider modifiers like completeness, bladder/bowel physiology, and management strategies. Finally, I should synthesize a concise clinical answer stating the threshold and outlining practical implications for monitoring and prevention of triggers, while self-checking for any conflicting sources that suggest a different cutoff like T7 and resolving that discrepancy with the weight of evidence [^113v3WE3].

> Let me first confirm the anatomic rationale, because the pathophysiology should anchor the cutoff level. Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) emerges when supraspinal inhibitory control over sympathetic outflow is interrupted such that noxious afferents below the lesion elicit unchecked segmental sympathetic reflexes, especially from the splanchnic vascular bed; clinically, this is classically described in lesions at or above the sixth thoracic segment where the critical splanchnic outflow lies, making T6 a physiologically coherent threshold [^114bh72B] [^113BcDGs] [^115ofPMk].

> Next, I should review the strongest primary data that set a practical threshold. A prospective cohort of 300 individuals undergoing urodynamics identified lesion level T6 or above as an independent predictor of AD, with an odds ratio of 5.5 versus T7 or below, and this remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, completeness, and other factors; this strongly supports T6 as the clinically relevant cutoff [^111PVLmL].

> Hmm, wait a minute — some sources categorize "at-risk" as at or above T7, so I should double-check whether that reflects evidence or convenience in survey stratification. Indeed, community surveys sometimes stratify risk groups at T7 for analytic purposes, but when I reconcile this with mechanistic anatomy and prospective risk modeling, the weight of evidence converges on T6 as the threshold; so while T7 appears in survey methods, the more defensible clinical cutoff is T6 given the splanchnic sympathetic physiology and the prospective cohort data [^111jM4uu] [^111PVLmL] [^113DN1t6].

> I will now examine whether interventional and observational studies consistently enroll or analyze patients using the T6 threshold. Trials and cohorts focused on bowel and bladder triggers — like the randomized anal sphincter lidocaine block study and the onabotulinumtoxinA studies — consistently enroll patients with injuries at or above T6, implicitly reinforcing T6 as the risk-defining level; similarly, "silent" AD during bowel programs has been systematically documented in complete injuries above T6, further validating the threshold in real-world exposures and procedures [^113DN1t6] [^117Qf373] [^112h8gNY] [^1132WFNC].

> Let me consider the gradient of risk across levels because "at or above T6" is a binary threshold, but risk is not uniform. Registry data show a clear step-up in AD burden with higher lesions: cervical injuries have the highest mean AD scores, followed by upper thoracic, with a marked drop in lumbosacral injuries; this dovetails with the mechanistic expectation that more rostral lesions entail more extensive loss of descending control over cardiac and splanchnic sympathetic tone [^1169CukB] [^115MQa5a] [^113F5Jyf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without factoring in modifiers. I need to ensure I incorporate completeness of injury and trigger profiles, because even incomplete injuries above T6 can develop AD and bladder/bowel stimuli account for most episodes. The prospective cohort adjusted for completeness and still found T6-or-above to be an independent predictor; bladder physiology and management choices further modify risk, with higher AD rates during urodynamics in those with higher detrusor pressures and in settings of indwelling catheters or reconstructive surgery, while interventions that reduce afferent drive (like intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA) reduce AD frequency and severity, highlighting the prominent role of urogenital triggers [^111PVLmL] [^111jNBSS] [^113J7PGJ] [^111hHXHP].

> I should confirm practice implications in guidelines, because they usually codify the risk threshold operationally. Uro-neurology guidelines explicitly recommend hemodynamic monitoring during urodynamic and invasive procedures in patients at risk for AD and mandate immediate bladder drainage and test termination if AD occurs, reflecting the known risk profile centered on T6 or above; pharmacologic escalation is advised if AD persists post-drainage, again underscoring procedural vigilance in this cohort [^116dRtK1] [^115LrXGC] [^116HUfeo].

> Synthesis time — let me reconsider everything to ensure internal consistency. The neuroanatomy points to T6, prospective modeling quantifies heightened odds at T6 or above, interventional studies and procedural case series operationalize T6 as the inclusion or risk threshold, and large registries confirm a rostral-to-caudal gradient of AD burden with cervical injuries highest; therefore, the most defensible clinical answer is that spinal cord injuries at or above T6 are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia, encompassing all cervical (C1–C8) and thoracic T1–T6 lesions, whereas injuries at T7 and below are generally not associated with AD because descending sympathetic control of the splanchnic bed is relatively preserved, though rare exceptions and modifiers exist [^111PVLmL] [^113BcDGs] [^113DN1t6].

---

Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level [^113tMWUC], with the highest risk in cervical and upper thoracic lesions [^1169CukB] [^111PVLmL]. Injuries below T6 rarely cause AD because descending sympathetic control to the splanchnic bed is preserved [^115ofPMk] [^113BcDGs]. The risk and severity of AD increase with higher lesion levels and completeness of injury [^111hHXHP], and it can be triggered by noxious stimuli below the lesion, especially bladder or bowel distension [^1132WFNC] [^115LrXGC].

---

## Anatomical basis of autonomic dysreflexia

- **Sympathetic outflow**: The sympathetic nervous system originates from the thoracolumbar spinal cord (T1-L2), with major splanchnic sympathetic outflow from T5-T6.

- **Descending control**: Supraspinal pathways modulate sympathetic activity [^113v3WE3]; lesions above T6 disrupt this control, causing unopposed sympathetic reflexes.

- **Splanchnic bed**: The splanchnic vascular bed is a key resistance and capacitance region for blood pressure regulation; loss of descending control above T6 predisposes to AD [^113v3WE3].

---

## Clinical evidence for injury level and autonomic dysreflexia

Multiple studies and clinical guidelines consistently identify **T6 as the critical level** above which AD occurs:

- **Urodynamics**: A prospective cohort showed lesions at T6 or above had significantly higher odds of AD during urodynamics (OR 5.5) than T7 or below [^111PVLmL].

- **Splanchnic outflow**: AD is well recognized in lesions above T6, where descending control of sympathetic outflow is disrupted [^113BcDGs] [^115ofPMk].

- **Case reports**: AD has been documented in cervical and upper thoracic injuries, including C5 tetraplegia [^114bh72B] [^114s5cPf].

---

## Risk factors influencing severity and frequency

Several factors influence the **severity and frequency of AD episodes**:

| **Risk factor** | **Influence on AD** |
|-|-|
| Level of injury | Higher lesions (cervical, upper thoracic) increase risk and severity [^111PVLmL] [^1169CukB] |
| Completeness of injury | Complete injuries have more severe and frequent AD [^111PVLmL] [^111hHXHP] |
| Neurogenic detrusor overactivity | Increases AD risk during bladder events [^111PVLmL] [^117Qf373] |
| Bladder management | Indwelling catheters and high detrusor pressures increase AD [^111jNBSS] [^112bEge9] |
| Age | Older patients have higher AD risk during urodynamics [^111jNBSS] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Recognition**: AD is a medical emergency; prompt identification and removal of triggers are critical [^1172VJG2].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous blood pressure monitoring is essential during procedures in patients with injuries at or above T6 [^116dRtK1] [^115LrXGC].

- **Prevention**: Prophylactic measures, such as lidocaine anal block, can reduce AD during anorectal procedures [^113DN1t6].

- **Education**: Patients and caregivers should be educated about triggers and management strategies [^116fFNtt].

---

## Summary of key findings

T6 is the threshold above which **autonomic dysreflexia** occurs; cervical and upper thoracic injuries carry greater risk and severity. Bladder and bowel distension are **common triggers**, and effective management relies on prompt recognition, blood pressure monitoring, and rapid removal of the precipitating stimulus [^115LrXGC] [^116dRtK1]. Recognizing and managing AD promptly is essential to prevent **life-threatening complications** [^1172VJG2].

### Prediction of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamics: A prospective cohort study [^111PVLmL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition in patients with spinal cord injury, as it can lead to myocardial ischemia, brain hemorrhage, or even death. Urodynamic investigation is the gold standard to assess neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction due to spinal cord injury and reveal crucial pathological findings, such as neurogenic detrusor overactivity. However, neurogenic detrusor overactivity and urodynamic investigation are known to be leading triggers of autonomic dysreflexia. Therefore, we aimed to determine predictors of autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury during urodynamic investigation.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort study included 300 patients with spinal cord injuries and complete datasets of continuous non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring, recorded during same session repeat urodynamic investigation. We used logistic regression to reveal predictors of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic investigation.

- **Results**: We found that the level of injury and presence of neurogenic detrusor overactivity were the only two independent significant predictors for autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic investigation. A lesion at spinal segment T6 or above (odds ratio (OR) 5.5, 95% CI 3.2–9.4) compared to one at T7 or below, and presence of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (OR 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–4.9) were associated with significantly increased odds of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic investigation. Both odds persisted after adjustment for age, sex, completeness, and other relevant factors.

### Autonomic dysreflexia after intramuscular injection in traumatic tetraplegia: A case report [^114bh72B]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a syndrome characterized by a massive imbalance of reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in patients with spinal cord lesions above the splanchnic outflow (T6). It is marked by the sudden onset of a severe increase in blood pressure and can be potentially life-threatening. The most common causes are bladder and rectum distention. In this case study, an instance of autonomic dysreflexia developed after an intramuscular injection in a 29-year-old tetraplegic patient with a C5 American Spinal Injury Association grade A lesion. After careful scrutiny of the English literature, this clinical manifestation appears to be an unusual event.

### Autonomic dysreflexia and foot and ankle surgery [^113BcDGs]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a syndrome characterized by a massive imbalance of reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in patients with a spinal cord injury above the splanchnic outflow, specifically at the thoracic 6 level. This condition is marked by a sudden and severe rise in blood pressure and is potentially life-threatening. Due to the rapid onset and significant morbidity associated with this condition, it is crucial for those caring for patients with spinal cord injuries to be well-informed about this syndrome.

The paper presents a review of the literature to aid in understanding the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of autonomic dysreflexia. Additionally, two illustrative case reports are provided to enhance familiarity with the clinical manifestations and management strategies.

### Sympathetic skin responses and autonomic dysfunction in spinal cord injury [^115jrSjL]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Sympathetic skin responses (SSRs), a measure of sympathetic cholinergic sudomotor function, have been used in the assessment of autonomic dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). This review highlights the basic mechanisms underlying SSRs as well as their application to the SCI population.

- **Utility of SSRs**: We address the utility of SSRs in assessing autonomic function, the relationship between autonomic and sensorimotor impairment, and the association between SSRs and the sequelae of autonomic dysfunction in SCI, particularly autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension.

Overall, SSRs are a rapid, convenient, and non-invasive method illustrating that the severity of autonomic impairment can be independent from sensorimotor impairment. We suggest that SSRs be used in conjunction with other validated autonomic tests to predict or document autonomic dysfunction in SCI.

### Reduction in bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in spinal cord injury [^113J7PGJ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) are associated with potentially life-threatening events among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Given that the bladder is responsible for up to 85% of AD events in individuals with high-level SCI, strategies to mitigate this pathway are crucial. The present study demonstrated a reduction in the overall severity and frequency of bladder-related AD events one month following a Botox intervention for neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). These findings may prove a viable treatment strategy for the successful alleviation of episodes of AD, and possibly, amelioration of cardiovascular-related health risks associated with SCI. Furthermore, reductions in AD translated to an overall improvement in quality of life (QoL).

The observations from our study were likely attributed to the actions of Botox on temporary denervation of the detrusor muscle and consequential reduction in transmission of afferent sensory information from the urinary bladder to the spinal cord, known to trigger AD. Overall, findings from our study provide promising results and highlight the necessity to further explore the clinical benefits of Botox for the treatment of AD in individuals living with SCI.

### Clinical subsets of central cord syndrome: Is it a distinct entity from other forms of incomplete tetraplegia for research [^116v9kVd]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2024). Low credibility.

Central cord syndrome (CCS) is the most prevalent and debated incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) syndrome, characterized by more pronounced weakness of the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities. Various definitions include multiple clinical features under the single term of CCS, complicating the evaluation of its frequency, prognosis discussions, and outcomes research. Often, individuals with CCS are excluded from research protocols as it is believed to have a favorable prognosis. However, the ambiguous nature of CCS casts doubt on the validity of this practice.

The objective of this study was to categorize CCS into specific subsets with clear, quantifiable differences to enhance the ability to determine whether individuals with CCS or its subsets exhibit distinct neurological and functional outcomes relative to others with incomplete tetraplegia. This study retrospectively reviewed individuals with new motor incomplete tetraplegia from traumatic SCI who were enrolled in the Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database from 2010 to 2020.

Through an assessment of the prevailing criteria for CCS and data analysis, we used two key criteria — severity of distal upper extremity weakness (i.e. hands and fingers) and extent of symmetry — to delineate three CCS subsets: full CCS, unilateral CCS, and borderline CCS. Of the 1,490 participants in our sample, 17.5% had full CCS, 25.6% had unilateral CCS, and 9% had borderline CCS, together encompassing more than 50% of motor incomplete tetraplegia cases.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^115MQa5a]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

- **Baseline demographics**: On univariate analysis, higher AD scores were reported among people with complete injuries (3.91 vs 3.37, p = 0.03) and multiple UTIs (4.39 vs 2.66, p < 0.0001). As expected, higher AD scores were also reported for individuals with cervical/thoracic (CT) injuries versus lumbar/sacral (LS) injuries (3.83 CT vs 1.53 LS, p < 0.0001).

- **Correlations**: Higher AD scores correlated positively with worse NBD (r = 0.243, p < 0.0001) and more years since injury (r = 0.056, p = 0.03), but negatively with age (r = −0.189, p < 0.0001). Participants with chronic pain scored significantly higher on AD than those without (3.89 vs 2.86, p = 0.0004). Both mental (r = −0.173) and physical (r = 0.107) components of the SF-12 were also negatively correlated with AD scores (p < 0.0001), indicating that worse AD was associated with poorer quality of life.

There was no significant correlation between participant sex (p = 0.19) and AD scores or the NBSS and AD scores (r = 0.041, p = 0.11).

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^114rJFBE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is common in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and leads to numerous abnormalities, including profound cardiovascular and bowel dysfunction. In those with high-level lesions, bowel management is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia (AD; hypertension provoked by sensory stimuli below the injury level). Improving bowel care is integral for enhancing quality of life (QoL). We aimed to describe the relationships between bowel care, AD, and QoL in individuals with SCI.

We performed an online community survey of individuals with SCI. Those with injury at or above T7 were considered at risk for AD. Responses were received from 287 individuals with SCI (injury levels C1-sacral and average duration of injury 17.1 ± 12.9 years [standard deviation]). Survey completion rate was 73% (n = 210).

Bowel management was a problem for 78% of respondents: it interfered with personal relationships (60%) and prevented staying (62%) and working (41%) away from home. The normal bowel care duration was > 60 minutes in 24%, and most used digital rectal stimulation (59%); 33% reported bowel incontinence at least monthly. Of those at risk for AD (n = 163), 74% had AD symptoms during bowel care; 32% described palpitations. AD interfered with activities of daily living in 51%. Longer durations of bowel care (p < 0.001) and more severe AD (p = 0.04) were associated with lower QoL.

Bowel management is a key concern for individuals with SCI and is commonly associated with symptoms of AD. Further studies should explore ways to manage bowel dysfunction, increase self-efficacy, and ameliorate the quality of life among these individuals.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^111YaR9k]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

A large proportion of respondents (71% [137 of 192]) reported intentionally restricting their fluid intake. They reported intentional fluid restriction rarely (22% [43 of 192]), sometimes (29% [55 of 192]), and often (20% [39 of 192]) because of concerns about their bladder management. Fluid restriction was associated with younger age (p = 0.0092) and more severe symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) (p = 0.0146), autonomic dysreflexia (AD) (p = 0.0003), and fatigue (p = 0.0178).

### Reduction in bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in spinal cord injury [^117Qf373]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Bladder-related events, including neurogenic detrusor overactivity, are the leading cause of autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injuries. Self-reported autonomic dysreflexia is reduced following onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity; however, none of these trials have assessed autonomic dysreflexia events using the clinical cutoff of an increase in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg. This study used a prospective, open-label design from 2013 to 2014 to quantitatively assess the efficacy of one cycle of 200U intradetrusor-injected onabotulinumtoxinA (20 sites) on reducing the severity and frequency of bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia events and improving quality of life.

Twelve men and five women with chronic, traumatic spinal cord injuries at or above the sixth thoracic level, and concomitant autonomic dysreflexia and neurogenic detrusor overactivity, underwent blood pressure monitoring during urodynamics and over a 24-hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring pre- and one month post-treatment. Post-onabotulinumtoxinA, autonomic dysreflexia severity was reduced during urodynamics (systolic blood pressure increase: 42 ± 23 mm Hg vs. 20 ± 10 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and during bladder-related events across the 24-hour period (systolic blood pressure increase: 49 ± 2 mm Hg vs. 26 ± 22 mm Hg, p = 0.004). The frequency of 24-hour bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia events was also decreased post-onabotulinumtoxinA (4 ± 2 events vs. 1 ± 1 events, p < 0.001). Autonomic dysreflexia and incontinence quality of life indices were also improved post-onabotulinumtoxinA.

### Lidocaine anal block limits autonomic dysreflexia during anorectal procedures in spinal cord injury: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113DN1t6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a common and potentially dangerous hypertensive response to stimulation below the level of injury that occurs in patients with spinal cord injury at T6 or above. Rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation are among the stimuli that may precipitate autonomic dysreflexia. Instillation of topical local anesthetic into the rectum is the recommended prophylaxis against autonomic dysreflexia of anorectal origin. However, a previous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that topical lidocaine in the rectum does not blunt the autonomic dysreflexia response to anorectal procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine whether lidocaine anal sphincter block would be effective in limiting anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.

- **Methods**: We enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury above T6, who were having anorectal procedures (flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or anoscopic hemorrhoid ligation). In a double-blind fashion, patients were randomized for intersphincteric anal block with 1 percent lidocaine or normal saline (placebo) before the procedure. Blood pressure was measured before, during, and after the block and procedure.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients received lidocaine, and 13 received placebo. The groups were similar in age, level of injury, duration of spinal cord injury, type of procedure, and procedure duration. The mean maximal systolic blood pressure increase for the lidocaine group was 22 ± 14 mmHg, significantly lower than the placebo group's 47 ± 31 mmHg (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: The findings suggest that lidocaine anal sphincter block may be effective in reducing autonomic dysreflexia during anorectal procedures in patients with spinal cord injury.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^115mZ3yd]. Neurourology and urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Almost 300,000 people in the United States live with a spinal cord injury (SCI). The majority of these patients (74%–80%) report urologic dysfunction. Common urinary symptoms associated with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) include urinary incontinence, frequency, urgency, and retention, in addition to an increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). These symptoms can cause unexpected hospitalizations, social isolation, and significant economic burdens while also having a profound impact on quality of life (QoL). In fact, some individuals with SCI, both tetraplegic and paraplegic, assign greater importance to improving bladder and bowel function than mobility.

One SCI-related condition is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), characterized by episodic, uncontrolled elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP), with or without baroreflex-mediated bradycardia. AD occurs with injuries above the T6 level, and the risk for developing AD increases with higher levels of SCI, with up to 90% of patients with cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury being at risk. AD symptoms can occur up to 40 times per day and include debilitating headaches, sweating, flushing of the skin, piloerection, stuffy nose, blurred vision, and anxiety. The severity of these episodes ranges from silent to life-threatening and can result in myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, or death. Common triggers of AD are most frequently caused by bladder or rectal distension.

Most patients with SCI require both bladder and bowel management emptying strategies.

### Contemporary cardiovascular concerns after spinal cord injury: Mechanisms, maladaptations, and management [^113v3WE3]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) issues after spinal cord injury (SCI) are of paramount importance considering they are the leading cause of death in this population. Disruption of autonomic pathways leads to a highly unstable CV system, with impaired blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation. In addition to low resting BP, the majority of those with SCI suffer daily from transient episodes of aberrantly low and high BP, termed orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia, respectively.

In fact, autonomic issues, including resolution of autonomic dysreflexia, are frequently ranked by individuals with high-level SCI to be of greater priority than walking again. Owing to a combination of these autonomic disturbances and a myriad of lifestyle factors, the pernicious process of CV disease is accelerated post-SCI. Unfortunately, these secondary consequences of SCI are only beginning to receive appropriate clinical attention.

Immediately after high-level SCI, major CV abnormalities present in the form of neurogenic shock. Once subsided, new issues related to BP instability arise, including orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. This review describes autonomic control over the CV system before injury and the mechanisms underlying CV abnormalities post-SCI, while also detailing the end-organ consequences, including those of the heart, as well as the systemic and cerebral vasculature. The tertiary impact of CV dysfunction will also be discussed, such as the potential impediment of rehabilitation and impaired cognitive function.

### Baroreflex function after spinal cord injury [^115ofPMk]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2012). Low credibility.

Significant cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunction occurs after spinal cord injury (SCI). It is now recognized that cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCI. Patients with SCI may also suffer severe orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. Baroreflex sensitivity (i.e. the capability of the autonomic nervous system to detect and respond effectively to acute changes in blood pressure) has been recognized as having predictive value for cardiovascular events, as well as playing a role in effective short-term regulation of blood pressure.

The purpose of this article is to review the mechanisms underlying effective baroreflex function, describe the techniques available to measure baroreflex function, and summarize the literature examining baroreflex function after SCI. Finally, we describe the potential mechanisms responsible for baroreflex dysfunction after SCI and propose future avenues for research.

Briefly, although cardiovagal baroreflex function is reduced markedly in those with high-level lesions (above the T6 level), the reduction appears to be partially mitigated in those with low-level lesions. Although no studies have examined the sympathetic arm of the baroreflex in those with SCI, despite this being arguably more important to blood pressure regulation than the cardiovagal baroreflex, nine articles have examined sympathetic responses to orthostatic challenges; these findings are reviewed.

Future studies are needed to describe whether dysfunctional baroreflex sensitivity after SCI is due to arterial stiffening or a neural.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^116fFNtt]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Most individuals (84%) were aware of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and whether they had experienced it. This suggests that educational strategies in this area have largely been effective. However, a number of respondents with lesion levels placing them at risk for AD did not know if they had it, despite describing symptoms of AD during their bowel care. This suggests there is still room for improvement in education about the risk profile, identifying signs and symptoms of AD, and knowing when to seek assistance for AD management.

More generally, although AD awareness was high in this sample, AD was described as impacting quality of life (QoL) and interfering with activities of daily living. This suggests that education and resources concerning the management of AD are priorities for those living with spinal cord injury (SCI). Individuals who were particularly likely to experience severe symptoms of AD were younger, had more complicated bowel care routines, and required longer times for their bowel care. It is probable that the longer duration and magnitude of the afferent stimulus for AD during more complex and lengthy routines underlies the more severe symptoms of AD. This highlights the need to ameliorate symptoms in these individuals, either pharmacologically or behaviorally, through reductions in the time required to complete bowel care and decreases in the number of stimuli used.

### Neuroprotection, plasticity manipulation, and regenerative strategies to improve cardiovascular function following spinal cord injury [^113KnVh7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2015). Low credibility.

Damage to the central nervous system, as in the case of spinal cord injury (SCI), results in disrupted supraspinal sympathetic influence and subsequent cardiovascular control impairments. Consequently, people with SCI suffer from disordered basal hemodynamics and devastating fluctuations in blood pressure, as in the case of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which likely contributes to this population's leading cause of mortality: cardiovascular disease. The development of AD is related, at least in part, to neuroanatomical changes that include disrupted descending supraspinal sympathetic control, changes in propriospinal circuitry, and inappropriate afferent sprouting in the dorsal horn. These anatomical mechanisms may thus be targeted by neural regenerative and protective therapies to improve cardiovascular control and reduce AD.

- **Biochemical strategies**: We review studies investigating biochemical strategies to reduce the severity of AD through: 1) reducing aberrant calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive afferent sprouting; 2) inhibiting inflammatory processes; and 3) re-establishing descending supraspinal sympathetic control.

Finally, we discuss why additional biochemical agents and combinational approaches may be needed to completely ameliorate this condition.

### Reduction in bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in spinal cord injury [^112h8gNY]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Bladder-related events, including neurogenic detrusor overactivity, are the leading cause of autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injuries. Self-reported autonomic dysreflexia is reduced following onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity; however, none of these trials have assessed autonomic dysreflexia events using the clinical cutoff of an increase in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg.

This study used a prospective, open-labelled design from 2013 to 2014 to quantitatively assess the efficacy of one cycle 200 U intradetrusor-injected onabotulinumtoxinA (20 sites) on reducing the severity and frequency of bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia events and improving quality of life. Twelve men and five women with chronic, traumatic spinal cord injuries at or above the sixth thoracic level, and concomitant autonomic dysreflexia and neurogenic detrusor overactivity, underwent blood pressure monitoring during urodynamics and over a 24-hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring pre- and one month post-treatment.

- **Reduction in severity and frequency**:
	- During urodynamics, autonomic dysreflexia severity was reduced post-onabotulinumtoxinA (systolic blood pressure increase: 42 ± 23 mm Hg vs. 20 ± 10 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and during bladder-related events across the 24-hour period (systolic blood pressure increase: 49 ± 2 mm Hg vs. 26 ± 22 mm Hg, p = 0.004). The frequency of 24-hour bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia events also decreased post-treatment (4 ± 2 events vs. 1 ± 1 event, p < 0.001).

The study further demonstrated improvements in autonomic dysreflexia and incontinence quality of life indices.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112h6XR1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Participants were asked about whether they had experienced autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), and how often they experienced these conditions. Five-point ordered Likert scales were used to assess symptoms of AD during bowel care and at other times of the day. Frequencies of AD symptoms were assessed using a range of "Never", "Rarely", "Monthly", "Weekly", and "Daily", while severity was assessed as "Not experienced", "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe", and "Very severe".

When considering symptoms of AD during bowel care, symptoms were examined in their full response form, as well as in a dichotomized format: "experienced" (mild, moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms reported) and "not experienced" (no symptoms experienced). We also inquired about symptoms of AD in response to 12 other common AD stimuli and provided participants with the option to add an "other" category to identify additional stimuli.

An overall symptom severity score of AD, both overall and during bowel care, was determined by assigning numerical values to the Likert scale responses ("Never" or "Not experienced" = 0; "Rarely" or "Mild" = 1; "Monthly" or "Moderate" = 2; "Weekly" or "Severe" = 3; and "Daily" or "Very severe" = 4) and summing the responses to individual symptoms. "Other" symptoms were scored similarly when identified and included in the overall symptom score, as we were particularly interested in the overall symptom burden of AD. The use of "boosting" through deliberate initiation of AD was also considered.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^112bEge9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

High autonomic dysreflexia (AD) scores are noted not only in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) who have cervical injuries but also among those with severe bladder and bowel symptoms. Patients using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for bladder management reported fewer AD symptoms than those utilizing indwelling catheters (IDC) and surgical reconstruction. Bladder augmentation was associated with higher AD scores compared to urinary diversion.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^116cskTz]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The NBRG‐SCI registry is a multicenter, prospective observational cohort that evaluates self‐reported bladder‐related outcomes from patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Data was collected between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017 (NTC06216081 and HSRP20153564). Participants were consentable, English‐proficient individuals above 18 years willing to answer five sets of questionnaires over one year. Exclusion criteria included congenital SCI like cerebral palsy or spina bifida and progressive SCI. The study methodology has been published previously, and the study was approved by the institutional review board (15‐PAF06991).

- **Participants**: Upon enrollment, participants were interviewed to report demographics and baseline data. Baseline data included comorbidities, relevant past medical and surgical history (both urologic and non‐urologic), the background for SCI, medications, past and present bladder and bowel management, and associated complications or hospitalizations. Four bladder management strategies were assessed: (1) surgical reconstruction, (2) indwelling catheter (IDC), (3) clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), or (4) reflexive voiding.

After the enrollment interview, patients completed electronic questionnaires, including the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction (NBD) for bowel‐specific difficulties, the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) for bladder‐specific outcomes, the modified spinal cord injury (SCI) SF‐12 for quality of life and psychosocial measures, and chronic pain reported as a dichotomous yes or no variable. All electronic questionnaires were administered via the secure and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)‐compliant Assessment Center Platform.

### Discitis following urinary tract infection manifesting as recurrent autonomic dysreflexia related to truncal movements in a person with tetraplegia [^114s5cPf]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old male with tetraplegia (C-5 AIS-A, American Spinal Cord Injury Association Standard Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale) developed a urinary tract infection and received appropriate antibiotics. Subsequently, he exhibited symptoms of sweating and shivering when sitting up, which resolved while lying on his back. Autonomic dysreflexia, triggered by truncal movements, continued for three months. A CT scan of the spine revealed L5-S1 discitis, while an MRI showed diffuse marrow oedema in the L5 and S1 vertebrae and a large abscess at the L5/S1 level. Blood culture yielded Serratia marcescens sensitive to meropenem. Treatment with meropenem followed by ertapenem was administered for 12 weeks. After 11 months, an MRI showed resolution of the discitis and epidural collection. The patient could sit up for nine hours without developing autonomic dysreflexia. If an individual with cervical spinal cord injury develops posture-related autonomic dysreflexia — such as in sitting position, lying on the sides, or while hoisted — disco-vertebral pathology should be suspected.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^1169CukB]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

The registry consisted of 1,473 individuals with AD scores, of which 889 (60%) were men, and the mean age was 45 years. Of the participants, 904 (62%) were paraplegic, and 563 (38%) had complete injury. The mean time since injury was 14.5 years ± 11.8. Bladder management strategies were categorized as CIC in 750 (51%), IDC in 269 (18%), surgery in 195 (13%), and voiding in 259 (18%).

- **Injury level**:
	- 627 were cervical (43%)
	- 677 thoracic (46%)
	- 126 (9%) sacral or lumbar
	- 43 participants did not report the level of injury

The mean AD score among all participants was 3.58 ± 4.70. The mean AD score for each level of SCI was 5.16 ± 4.92 in cervical, 2.59 ± 4.28 in thoracic, and 1.53 ± 3.48 for sacral and lumbar patients (p < 0.001). The mean NBSS was 24.14 ± 10.77, while the mean NBD was 12.49 ± 6.48.

### Cerebral blood flow responses to autonomic dysreflexia in humans with spinal cord injury [^116HLiHn]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a life-threatening episode of transient hypertension affecting up to 90% of those with high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) and can lead to cerebral hemorrhage. Due to the nature of this medical emergency, cerebral blood flow (CBF) has not been recorded during AD. Beat-by-beat blood pressure (BP) and CBF velocity of the middle cerebral artery were measured during spontaneous AD episodes in four motor complete cervical SCI patients. Mean arterial BP increased during AD (66 ± 11 vs. 83 ± 10 mm Hg; p = 0.004), whereas CBF (76 ± 4 vs. 74 ± 4 cm · sec(-1)) and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) (35 ± 1 vs. 34 ± 3 mm Hg) were maintained. These preliminary data indicate that the brain may effectively buffer moderate episodes of AD.

### Autonomic dysreflexia in acute spinal cord injury: An under-recognized clinical entity [^115tqZJH]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2003). Low credibility.

While autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is well recognized in the chronic stage of spinal cord injury (SCI), this potentially life-threatening complication has been only rarely documented in the acute phase (1 month) after SCI. Based on our clinical experience, we hypothesized that AD is under-recognized in the acute phase of SCI. This study was undertaken to determine the incidence and clinical associations of early AD in our center.

We reviewed the charts of patients with acute traumatic SCI admitted to the Toronto Western Hospital Spinal Program between 1998 and 2000. Among 58 patients with acute traumatic SCI (15 female, 43 male; ages 17–89 years, mean of 55.4), all three individuals who developed evidence of early AD had complete cervical tetraplegia (1 female, 2 male; ages 31–42 years, mean of 38.3). The incidence of early AD was 5.2% (3 of 58), whereas the adjusted incidence for the population at risk (SCI at T6 or above) was 5.7% (3 of 53). A significant number of patients in this series (87.9%, or 51 of 58) had a cervical SCI.

The mean resting systolic arterial blood pressure among these three individuals was 105.7 ± 3 mm Hg. The mean systolic blood pressure at the time of early AD was 173.3 ± 14.8 mm Hg, with an increase in systolic blood pressure over baseline ranging from 35.5% to 95%. The earliest episode of AD occurred on the 4th post-injury day. The trigger mechanisms for AD were somatic pain, fecal impaction, and abdominal distention.

Although numerous reports emphasize AD as a potential complication of chronic SCI, our study demonstrates that AD occurs in 5.7% of patients with acute SCI.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^117Su8NQ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Although we were primarily interested in the relationships between autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and bowel care, it was interesting that AD was reported to interfere with numerous other common activities, including sleep, exercise, normal daily activities, and sexual function. Many of these triggers are well known and underscore the need to find effective management strategies for AD. However, the association between AD interfering with sleep has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. This may seem surprising because we do not think of many triggers for AD being present during sleep.

However, considering that most respondents reported conducting their bowel care first thing in the morning or in the evening, it is possible the colon filling initiates AD ahead of morning bowel care or that evening bowel care triggers symptoms of AD that continue unabated — even once the offending stimulus has been removed. Further, bladder triggers for AD may also peak in the night as the bladder progressively fills. Urine production is also higher at night than during the day in individuals with high-level lesions, which could further exacerbate the nocturnal bladder stimulus. Together, these triggers could combine to exacerbate AD and interfere with sleep.

Disruption of sleep is particularly concerning among individuals with high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) who experience AD because many already suffer from profound fatigue related to low resting cerebral blood flow during the day, and poor sleep further exacerbates fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and excessive daytime sleepiness.

### Autonomic dysreflexia in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [^113W7Urw]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in patients with spinal cord injury and is characterized by unbalanced sympathetic discharge caused by noxious stimuli from a site below the spinal cord lesion. An 11-year-old boy with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and spinal cord involvement exhibited episodes of intense flushing and sweating confined to the head and neck region, accompanied by hypertension and tachycardia. His symptoms improved after changing a partly blocked bladder catheter. The clinical features suggested autonomic dysreflexia. Early recognition of autonomic dysreflexia is crucial, as removing the precipitating trigger may be life-saving.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^112dCv9Z]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Low credibility.

These guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of select demographic and clinical variables, as well as prediction models when counseling patients, families, and surrogates of individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI). We categorized these predictors as reliable, moderately reliable, or not reliable. This categorization was based on a GRADE-based assessment of certainty in the body of evidence, as well as effect size (quantification of predictor accuracy) across published studies, as detailed in Supplementary Appendix 1 and Table 1.

Reliable predictors and prediction models, for the purposes of these guidelines, may be used to formulate a prognosis when the appropriate clinical context is present, in the absence of potential confounders. These are predictors with clear, actionable thresholds, or clinical/radiographic definitions and a low rate of error in the prediction of outcomes, with at least moderate certainty in the body of evidence. When prognosis is formulated on the basis of one or more reliable predictors, the clinician may describe the outcome as "very likely" during counseling.

Given the inherent limitations in neuroprognostication research, the clinician must nevertheless acknowledge the presence of uncertainty — even if low — in the prognosis during counseling. Moderately reliable individual predictors may be used for prognostication only when additional reliable or moderately reliable individual predictors are present, in addition to the appropriate clinical context. These are also predictors with clear, actionable thresholds or clinical/radiographic definitions.

### Risk factors to develop autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic examinations in patients with spinal cord injury [^111jNBSS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

The risk factors for developing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) during urodynamic (UD) examination in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) above Th6 remain unclear. The main goal of our study is to investigate the risk factors associated with AD in these patients.

The study utilized a cross-sectional survey design and involved 83 patients with SCI above Th6, who underwent a UD examination at our center. AD was defined as a rise in systolic blood pressure above 15 mm Hg with a pulse rate below 60 beats per minute.

The prevalence rate of AD among our patients was 54%. Univariate analysis showed several risk factors: patient's age, SCI completeness, traumatic etiology, indwelling catheter, presence of chills or sweating, anticholinergic treatment, maximum detrusor voiding pressure, detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate, detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia, and bladder outlet obstruction. Using multivariate logistic regression, we identified two independent risk factors: patient's age equal to or above 45 years (OR = 10.995) and maximum detrusor voiding pressure equal to or above 31 cm H2O (OR = 3.879).

According to our results, the patient's age and maximum detrusor voiding pressure should be considered during a UD examination to prevent the sudden onset of AD in patients with SCI above Th6.

### Development of a systems medicine approach to spinal cord injury [^116CWfj4]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Low credibility.

Normal network physiology requires rapid stabilizing feedback, regulated mainly by the central and peripheral nervous and neuroendocrine systems. Allostasis refers to the dynamic regulatory adaptations within normal physiological ranges that maintain stability in physiologic systems such as autonomic, central nervous, neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems. Allostatic mechanisms restore "homeostasis" after perturbations through feedback loop corrections, including thermoregulation, peripheral vascular resistance, and inflammation control. Following SCI, the adaptive capacity of allostatic feedback is variably lost, mainly due to distributed autonomic system disruptions (see Fig. 3). When a physiological system is destabilized beyond homeostatic boundaries, allostatic load (AL) is generated. Chronic AL contributes to accumulating damage, reduced resilience, accelerated system aging, and potentiation of adverse health conditions. After SCI, many systems cannot "normalize", resulting in measurable AL (see Fig. 4). This increases vulnerability to metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease (CVD), infection, chronic pain, and chronic inflammation due to neuroendocrine and immune dysfunction. Overall, these changes may reduce resilience and increase frailty. At a genetic level, polymorphisms may increase vulnerability to developing AL, and AL can drive epigenetic change within the individual genome.

### The management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction after spinal cord injury [^1178SHtJ]. Nature Reviews Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of patients with neurogenic bladder has changed substantially over the past decades. Obtaining balanced lower urinary tract function has become possible in most patients, although urological complications remain among the most serious these patients are likely to experience and, even today, these can have a negative effect on quality of life.

To this extent, patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are likely to develop neurogenic bladder, and data are available on most aspects of neurogenic bladder in these patients. Data on physiology and pathophysiology form the basis of our understanding of patients' symptoms and also provide a foundation for the management of these patients.

Use of conservative and/or more invasive treatment measures, their complications, and measures to prevent these complications, are all important clinical aspects that merit discussion. Considerable progress has been made in the urological management of patients with SCI over the past decades, but opportunities remain to make diagnosis more accurate and therapy more successful.

### Cardiac consequences of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury [^1172VJG2]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which describes episodic hypertension, is highly prevalent in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). In non-SCI, primary hypertension depresses cardiac contractile reserve via β-adrenergic mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether AD contributes to the impairment in cardiac contractile function that accompanies SCI. We induced SCI in rodents and stratified them into sham, SCI, or SCI plus repetitive induction of AD. At 6 weeks post-SCI, we assessed cardiac function using in vivo (speckle-tracking echocardiography), ex vivo (working heart), and molecular approaches (Western blot).

We also provide unique translational insight by comparing the relationship between the number of daily AD events and cardiac function in 14 individuals with cervical SCI. We found SCI and SCI plus repetitive induction of AD exhibited a reduction in left ventricular dimensions at 6 weeks post-SCI versus preinjury (P < 0.049). Compared with sham, SCI exhibited a reduction in peak radial strain along with a downward and rightward shift in the Starling curve (P < 0.037), both of which were further depressed in SCI plus repetitive induction of AD (P < 0.042). In response to β-adrenergic stimulation, SCI plus repetitive induction of AD exhibited an attenuated increase in contractile indices (P < 0.001), despite no differences in β-receptor expression within the left ventricle. Our clinical data confirm our experimental findings by demonstrating significant associations between the number of daily AD events and markers of systolic and diastolic function along with left ventricular measures.

### Charcot arthropathy in relation to autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury: Case report and review of the literature [^111nq8nM]. Journal of Neurosurgery. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Charcot spinal arthropathy has been described as a late complication of spinal cord injury. In patients with these injuries in whom the spine below the level of injury is insensate, joint trauma can progress until spinal instability ensues. The authors describe the case of a 50-year-old man with complete C-8 tetraplegia who experienced a 4-month history of episodic severe headaches, profuse sweating over his face and arms, and episodic severe hypertension in addition to a "grinding" sensation in the lower back. Charcot arthropathy at the T11–12 levels with pathological mobility was demonstrated on neuroimaging. Intraoperatively, a complete spinal cord transection was identified. Anterior and posterior thoracolumbar fusion across the mobile segment resulted in complete amelioration of signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. This entity, a common condition in the setting of spinal cord injury, has many triggers. Definitive treatment is targeted at the removal of the underlying cause. As demonstrated here, Charcot spinal arthropathy can act as a powerful trigger for induction of autonomic dysreflexia. Treatment of the associated spinal instability resulted in eradication of all signs and symptoms of the dysreflexia.

### Crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with spinal cord injury [^11591ZFk]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Crusted scabies, also referred to as Norwegian scabies, is caused by an infestation with the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. Unlike classic scabies, in which a human host may be infected with 10 to 15 mites, an aberrant host response in crusted scabies leads to colonization with millions of mites. This condition is most often observed in patients with decreased sensory function and those who are immunocompromised, such as the elderly and those with underlying HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 infection, and malignancy.

Clinically, patients present with generalized thick, hyperkeratotic, psoriasiform, or eczematous-like plaques, most notably on acral surfaces. Pruritus may be absent. Systemically, generalized lymphadenopathy, peripheral eosinophilia, elevated immunoglobulin E levels, sleep disturbances, and secondary superinfections with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are reported. Here, we present a rare case of untreated crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with an underlying spinal cord injury.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^116Q2hTB]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates a phenotype for at-risk patients for worse autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in addition to establishing an independent relationship between AD symptoms, more severe bladder and bowel symptoms, and long-term bladder management strategy. In an unadjusted assessment of the phenotype of individuals at risk for AD, the greatest risk factors were younger age, greater time from injury, the presence of chronic pain, more urinary tract infections (UTIs), higher injury levels, worse bowel symptoms, quadriplegia, completeness of injury, and worse quality of life (QoL) symptom scores for both mental and physical portions. We found no association between sex and AD; these results align with similar studies demonstrating AD to be gender-independent and more common among younger patients.

In the univariate model, the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) was not associated with AD severity; however, we found that worse urinary and bowel symptoms independently correlate with higher AD severity in the multivariate model. One explanation for this disparity may be that in the univariate model, worsening bladder symptoms are not stratified by injury level or bladder management type. Our data show a robust relationship between bladder management, urinary symptoms, and AD severity independently. Hence, injury level and bladder management may have confounded the relationship between AD and urinary symptom severity. Overall, these findings build on previously reported relationships between AD severity and worse bladder and bowel symptoms in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

### International surveillance study in acute spinal cord injury confirms viability of multinational clinical trials [^115dVkM1]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury is a devastating neurological disorder associated with a lifelong neurological condition characterized by motor, sensory, and autonomic deficits. Damage to the spinal cord occurs through both mechanical perturbation (primary injury) and a cascade of damaging pathophysiological events (secondary injury). Currently, there are no pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions available that mitigate the extent of damage in the acutely injured spinal cord. Despite the lack of effective treatment options, considerable progress has been made toward reducing the mortality and morbidity rates among patients with spinal cord injury. This progress is chiefly attributable to advances in acute and long-term care, including early spine surgery (decompression and stabilization), blood pressure augmentation within the first week post-injury, introduction of antibiotics, availability of specialized rehabilitation centers, and various rehabilitation practices such as gait training. Additionally, the prevention and treatment of secondary complications, such as infections and neuropathic pain, have significantly contributed to improved patient outcomes.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^111DZXCL]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

In terms of reducing the severity of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) pharmacologically, one approach has been to mitigate the afferent stimulus using anesthetic lubricants during bowel care. However, guidelines regarding the use of topical anesthesia to minimize AD during known triggers, such as bowel care, are conflicting. This is noted in the spinal cord injury (SCI) community, with uncertainty about different techniques and strategies for managing AD when performing bowel care at home. Clearer recommendations and additional education are warranted.

Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH), including fainting, lightheadedness, dizziness, and lethargy, were also reported by a significant proportion of respondents. Triggers for these symptoms included positional changes and sitting. These symptoms can further compound the challenges that individuals with SCI face in their daily lives, work, and leisure activities and are strongly associated with fatigue.

There is mounting evidence that hypotension is not a benign condition, and that hypotension and associated cerebral hypoperfusion should be avoided, as they include documented attention deficits and other mild cognitive impairments in hypotensive individuals with SCI. Therefore, there is a strong rationale to increase education about hypotension, its symptoms, and positional counter maneuvers and, potentially, to encourage self-monitoring of blood pressure at home. These measures should target those most at risk — individuals with high-level lesions and younger individuals with SCI. In particular, given that 71% of individuals reported intentionally restricting their fluid intake because of these challenges, focused interventions are critical.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112duGmx]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Sixteen common symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) were also assessed using the same frequency range and severity. These symptoms were also assigned a composite severity score in the same manner as the autonomic dysreflexia (AD) data. We also asked about symptoms of OH in response to 10 other common OH stimuli and provided an opportunity for individuals to add a category "other" to identify additional stimuli. Participants were asked about their fainting history.

Participants were asked whether symptoms of OH or AD had ever interfered in their ability to participate in common activities such as activities of daily living, work, exercise, sexual activity, rehabilitation, household chores, driving, and social activities. A category "other" was available for participants to identify additional activities.

Participants were asked if they experienced symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia, such as heart palpitations, irregular heartbeats, or a feeling of "fluttering in the chest" during bowel care, and, if yes, how often this occurred (daily, weekly, monthly, rarely, or never).

Fatigue was scored on a linear scale (0, no fatigue; 10, severe fatigue).

- **Stratification of participants by injury level**: For analysis of cardiovascular symptoms, participants were stratified by their self-reported injury level into two subgroups: those with injury at or above the seventh thoracic segment (T7) and those with injuries below T7. High-level injuries can disrupt the sympathetic control of the heart and the vasculature in the splanchnic bed, increasing susceptibility to OH, AD, and cardiac arrhythmia.

### Silent autonomic dysreflexia during a routine bowel program in persons with traumatic spinal cord injury: a preliminary study [^1132WFNC]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this preliminary study was to determine the existence and frequency of silent autonomic dysreflexia in subjects with a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) above the neurologic level of T6.

- **Design**: Prospective design.

- **Setting**: Blood pressure monitoring of subjects during a routine bowel program.

- **Participants**: Ten subjects with chronic (> 1 year), complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale class A) SCI with a neurologic level of injury above T6.

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: An increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of greater than 20 to 40 mmHg above baseline or an SBP greater than 150 mmHg.

- **Results**: The mean resting blood pressure for the subject group was 104/65 mmHg. During the bowel program, no subject reported experiencing any of the classic symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. The mean maximum blood pressure recorded during the bowel program was 160/90 mmHg. All patients had an increase in SBP greater than 20 mmHg above baseline, and 70% had an increase in SBP greater than 40 mmHg above baseline. Sixty percent of subjects had an increase in SBP greater than 150 mmHg, with 40% of subjects reaching an SBP greater than 170 mmHg at least once during their bowel program.

The conclusion of the study is that silent autonomic dysreflexia occurs frequently in SCI during bowel programs. Further study is recommended to determine whether preventative measures or treatment is needed.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^112DSQ43]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

- **Good practice statements**: In accordance with recommendations of the GRADE network, these statements were considered by the panel to be actionable, supported by indirect evidence where appropriate, and essential to guide the practice of neuroprognostication. The good clinical practices reflected in these statements lacked a meaningful body of direct supporting evidence — typically because of insufficient clinical equipoise — but were considered by the panel to be unequivocally beneficial.

- **Good practice statement #1**: We recommend that prognostication should be performed with consideration of the complete clinical condition and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

	- **Rationale**: Neuroprognostication in traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) is complicated by heterogeneity in injury patterns, management strategies, and study methodology. Clinicians must therefore use caution when formulating a prognosis with the predictors addressed in these guidelines. Additionally, the overall body of literature on tSCI outcomes is of poor quality. Most studies performed retrospective analyses of registry databases that, even with prospective enrollment, may exclude important variables. Studies based on retrospective chart review have additional limitations, especially for the determination of outcomes. Given these limitations, prognostication can be improved through consideration of multiple predictors. Decisions should always be made with attention to individual patient characteristics, as well as preferences and values.

### Crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with spinal cord injury [^112jcfYQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to autonomic dysreflexia, scabies has been reported to trigger numerous other systemic diseases. Nine cases of scabies causing leukocytoclastic vasculitis have been reported. Scabies infestation has also been associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bullous pemphigoid. In all these disorders, it is hypothesized that the presence of the scabies mite causes a hypersensitivity-like reaction and immunoresponse to an unknown antigen in affected individuals.

Recently, there has been increased data supporting that patients with a history of treated scabies are at a long-term higher risk for other systemic diseases, such as autoimmune disease or stroke. A recent population-based cohort study revealed that, compared with matched controls, patients with a history of scabies showed an increased risk of developing hypersensitivity vasculitis, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis over a 7-year period. Similarly, another population-based study showed an elevated risk of stroke in patients with a history of scabies during a 7-year follow-up period. However, patients with scabies also had a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome, which is a well-established risk factor for stroke alone.

More research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis to better counsel patients with scabies, like the patient described in our case, about their imminent and long-term risks.

### Basal metabolic rate and autonomic nervous system dysfunction in men with spinal cord injury [^116BuiNS]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between autonomic nervous system dysfunction and basal metabolic rate (BMR), as well as the effect of spasticity on BMR.

Twenty men, including 11 paraplegic and 9 tetraplegic, with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)-A and -B grade chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in this study. Total body fat mass and lean tissue mass were measured in all participants using DXA by standard methods. Patients were divided into two groups to determine the effect of autonomic nervous system dysfunction on BMR:

- **Group I**: T6 and upper-level injuries with a history of autonomic dysreflexia.
- **Group II**: T7 and lower-level injuries without a history of autonomic dysreflexia.

Measurements of BMR were conducted through indirect calorimetry under standardized conditions.

- **Results**: There were 13 patients in Group I and 7 patients in Group II. The differences between these groups in terms of time since injury, BMI, age, weight, lean tissue mass, BMR, and BMR/kg were not significant.

The study concluded that autonomic nervous system dysfunction does not affect BMR, suggesting it might be ignored when considering energy needs in individuals with spinal cord injury.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in spinal cord injury: Clinical practicability [^113F5Jyf]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Trauma to the spinal cord often results in not only sensorimotor but also autonomic impairments. The loss of autonomic control over the cardiovascular system can cause profound blood pressure (BP) derangements in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) and may therefore lead to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this population. The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) allows insights into circadian BP profiles, which have been shown to have good prognostic value for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in able-bodied subjects.

Past studies in SCI subjects using ABPM have indicated that alterations in circadian BP patterns are dependent on the spinal lesion level. Tetraplegic subjects with sensorimotor complete lesions experience decreased daytime arterial BP, loss of the physiological nocturnal BP dip, and higher circadian BP variability. This includes potentially life-threatening hypertensive episodes known as autonomic dysreflexia (AD), compared with paraplegic and able-bodied subjects. The proposed underlying mechanisms of these adverse BP alterations are mainly attributed to a lost or decreased central drive to sympathetic spinal preganglionic neurons controlling the heart and blood vessels. Additionally, several maladaptive anatomical changes within the spinal cord and the periphery, as well as a general decrease in physical daily activity in SCI subjects, contribute to adverse BP changes.

ABPM enables the identification of adverse BP profiles and the associated increased risk for CVD in SCI subjects. Concurrently, it may also provide a useful clinical tool for managing these risks.

### Crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with spinal cord injury [^117WKAvs]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Intermittent attacks of autonomic dysreflexia, or "sympathetic storm", are well reported in patients with spinal cord injury at or above the T6 spinal level due to a decentralized spinal cord with interruption of descending modulation of thoracolumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons above that level. Acutely, patients present with hypotension and bradycardia, but autonomic imbalance and dysregulation of splanchnic circulation lead to sympathetic overactivity, hypertension, and baroreceptor-reflex-mediated bradycardia. Compensatory parasympathetic activity above the level of spinal injury could also cause secondary diaphoresis, rhinorrhea, and flushing.

Patients can experience up to 40 attacks daily; thus, swift identification of triggers is vital because devastating cardiophysiologic effects and even fatal complications can occur. Autonomic dysreflexia is well established in response to a number of noxious visceral and somatic stimuli below the level of injury, including urinary tract infections, deep vein thrombosis, constrictive clothing, pregnancy, orchitis, hemorrhoids, and surgical interventions. Cutaneous triggers of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury patients include skin infections, ulceration, and ingrown toenails. However, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which scabies infestation has been implicated. This is supported by the resolution of the patient's rash, peripheral eosinophilia, photophobia, bowel and bladder dysregulation, and labile blood pressures, with successful treatment of the infestation.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^111hHXHP]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

We investigated whether the severity of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) was associated with more patient-reported bladder and bowel symptoms and compared AD severity by bladder management strategy in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).

The Neurogenic Bladder Research Group SCI Registry is a prospective study that evaluated quality of life after SCI. Bladder and bowel symptoms were assessed through the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score and the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction score, respectively. AD severity was assessed with the Autonomic Dysreflexia Following Spinal Cord Injury (ADFSCI) instrument. Bladder management was classified as volitional voiding, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), indwelling catheter (IDC), and surgery (augmentation and diversion).

AD scores were identified for 1,473 people. The mean age was 45. Bladder management was CIC in 754 (51%), IDC in 271 (18%), surgery in 195 (13%), and voiding in 259 (18%). On univariate analysis, higher ADFSCI scores were associated with complete injuries (3.1 vs. 3.4, p = 0.03), cervical/thoracic injuries (3.8 vs. 1.5, p < 0.0001), and chronic pain (3.9 vs. 2.9, p = 0.0004). IDC (5.2) and surgery (4.5) had higher ADFSCI scores than CIC (3.0) and volitional voiding (2.8) (p < 0.0001). Sub-analysis showed that bladder augmentation had significantly higher ADSCI scores than diversion (4.7 vs. 3.7, p = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, the level of injury, bladder management, and bowel and bladder symptoms remained associated with worse AD.

In conclusion, the level of injury, age, worse bowel and bladder symptoms, and bladder management type were associated with AD severity.

### Reduction in bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in spinal cord injury [^111iyzuw]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

From a clinical perspective, intravesical injections of Botox have an approximated average efficacy of nine months. The duration of efficacy of Botox in reducing bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia (AD) frequency and severity beyond one month is not known.

Other limitations include a small sample size, loss to follow-up, and lack of a control arm. Future research studies can confirm our preliminary findings through the conduction of a large-scale randomized controlled clinical design.

### Autonomic dysreflexia: A plastic surgery primer [^113tMWUC]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Plastic surgeons are integral to the management team for patients with spinal cord injuries, with responsibilities including pressure sore management and upper extremity reconstruction. Injury to the spinal cord profoundly disrupts the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. In particular, the autonomic system can become unregulated, resulting in a massive sympathetic discharge called autonomic dysreflexia.

Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in the majority of patients with injuries above the sixth thoracic vertebra and causes sudden, severe hypertension. If left untreated, autonomic dysreflexia can result in stroke or death. Because this syndrome causes morbidity and mortality, it is crucial for plastic surgeons to be able to recognize and treat autonomic dysreflexia. This article reviews the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of this syndrome.

### Non-surgical urologic management of neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury [^111NSBQo]. World Journal of Urology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neurogenic bladder, specifically with respect to bladder expression, the ICUD/SIU 2018 guidelines recommend considering offering bladder expression in patients with lower motor neuron lesion disease or sacral spinal cord injury. This is applicable if video-urodynamics confirm normal bladder capacity, low leak point pressure, good compliance, no vesicoureteral reflux, an open bladder neck during voiding, and low voiding pressures.

### Non-surgical urologic management of neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury [^116ASmJJ]. World Journal of Urology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neurogenic bladder, specifically with respect to the re-evaluation of patients with new symptoms, ICUD/SIU 2018 guidelines recommend not ignoring the following non-specific signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients with spinal cord injury, which may suggest the presence of urinary infections:

- **Exacerbation of spasticity**: Increased muscle stiffness or spasms.

- **Difficulty to insert the catheter into the urethra**: Caused by spasms of the pelvic floor.

- **Worsening of incontinence**: Increased episodes of involuntary urination.

- **Fever**: Elevated body temperature indicative of infection.

- **Abdominal and back pain**: Discomfort that may suggest infection or other complications.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112AUD8F]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Worldwide, many individuals are living with the devastating consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition to the well-known motor and sensory consequences of SCI, descending spinal autonomic pathways can also be affected, leading to profound autonomic dysfunction. Although the autonomic consequences of SCI are widespread, key areas of concern identified by individuals living with SCI relate to issues of continence and cardiovascular dysfunction. These devastating effects are major problems for individuals with SCI as they represent frustrating and limiting secondary complications that are too often overlooked by the clinical and research communities. Indeed, individuals with SCI, including those with tetraplegia and paraplegia, have identified improving bowel function as a key target to enhance quality of life (QoL). Notably, issues surrounding bowel management are complicated by cardiovascular dysfunction triggered by the bowel care itself.

Bowel management concerns post-SCI are multifactorial, most commonly relating to neurogenic bowel, which is a colonic dysfunction resulting from lack of central nervous system control. Consequently, individuals with SCI often experience impaired QoL due to fecal incontinence, fecal urgency, constipation, hemorrhoids, and abdominal distention. Changes in bowel motility, sphincter control, and impaired hand function and mobility combine to make bowel management a key cause of morbidity post-SCI. Successful bowel management requires a multi-factorial approach, with important roles for dietary interventions.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^113N5Yto]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Lower AD and NBSS scores in the CIC population may also reflect a different bladder physiology compared to those managed with IDC. The NBSS-QoL is based on three domains: incontinence, physical factors (voiding and urine storage), and social factors. Patients who use CIC to empty at timed intervals may minimize bladder distension, which may explain why their AD is better managed. However, their urinary-QoL scores are likely worse because of the frequency with which the bladder needs to be emptied and the mechanical difficulty of performing CIC. Furthermore, the QoL differences observed in our previous report may also have reflected perceived improvement in other domains impacting QoL, such as time burden and independence, which is not always possible with CIC. At minimum, these findings add to the shared decision-making discussion regarding the potential impact of bladder management strategy on AD symptoms.

People with reconstructive bladder surgery also had more associated AD symptoms compared to CIC, and bladder augmentation was associated with worse AD symptoms than urinary diversion. This may be related to several possible reasons. First, patients with a bladder augment still have a native bladder that can trigger AD symptoms when distended, whereas those with a conduit or orthotopic diversion do not. Second, bladder augment surgeries could potentially negatively impact bowel function compared to a urinary diversion since a bladder augment requires more bowel (30–50 cm) than an ileal or colon loop diversion (8–12 cm).

### Hypothermia associated with autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury [^114pqTnh]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Individuals with traumatic upper thoracic and cervical spinal cord injuries are at increased risk for the development of both thermoregulatory dysfunction and autonomic dysreflexia. It is unclear, however, what effect reflex autonomic sympathetic outflow has on thermoregulatory dysfunction during episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. The following case of an individual with C5 tetraplegia and both thermoregulatory dysfunction and autonomic dysreflexia illustrates the profound effects that the autonomic nervous system may have on body temperature in individuals at risk for this complication.

### Quantitative analysis of dysautonomia in patients with autonomic dysreflexia [^113Et29A]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a life-threatening condition for individuals with cervical or high-thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). The profile of autonomic dysfunction in AD using validated clinical autonomic tests has not been described so far, although it could be useful to identify SCI patients at greater risk of developing AD non-invasively. With this objective, 37 SCI patients (27% female) were recruited, and hemodynamic and cardiac parameters were continuously monitored to determine the presence of AD, defined as an increase of systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or higher after bladder filling with saline. Standard autonomic function testing was performed, including deep breathing, Valsalva manoeuvre, and tilt table test. Additionally, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability were measured at rest. Catecholamines and vasopressin levels were also measured at supine and upright positions. The severity of SCI was assessed through clinical and radiological examinations.

AD was observed in 73.3% of SCI patients, with 63.6% of them being asymptomatic during the dysreflexive episode. AD patients displayed a drop in sympathetic outflow, as determined by decreased noradrenaline plasma levels, reduced sympathovagal balance, and increased BRS. In line with decreased sympathetic activity, the incidence of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension was higher in AD patients. Our results provide novel evidence regarding the autonomic dysfunction in SCI patients with AD compared to non-AD patients, demonstrating the potential for non-invasively measured autonomic parameters to identify at-risk individuals.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^111jM4uu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Severity of symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia during bowel care in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) considered at risk for cardiovascular dysfunction is illustrated in Figure 1. Individuals were considered at risk for cardiovascular abnormalities if they had a self-reported lesion level at or above T7. Each symptom was classified according to its perceived severity.

We considered individuals with injuries at or above T7, who had at least one symptom of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) triggered during bowel care, to have AD (n = 123). The analysis of the following AD-specific questions was conducted on this subset of individuals. AD was reported to interfere with at least one activity by 68% (83 of 122) of respondents with AD, and the impact was wide-ranging. At least 50% of these respondents identified AD as interfering with social activities, activities of daily living, work, exercise, and sleep (Figure 2A). Only 4% (4 of 110) of those with injuries at or above T7 reported deliberately provoking AD to boost sports performance. The majority of respondents who experienced AD identified a number of other stimuli that trigger these symptoms, most notably bladder care (89%; 101 of 114) and pain (75%; 84 of 112).

- **Influence of AD outside of bowel care**:
	- Prevalence of autonomic dysreflexia interfering with common activities.
	- Additional stimuli that trigger autonomic dysreflexia symptoms in those with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia during bowel care.

More severe symptoms of AD were associated with a younger age (p = 0.009), indicating that younger individuals might experience more complicated bowel and AD symptoms.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^1154vu2d]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Low credibility.

- **Evidence to recommendation criteria**: Quality of evidence/certainty in the evidence and effect size - For the purpose of these guidelines, predictors described as "reliable" have both a higher overall certainty in the evidence and a greater effect size than "moderately reliable" predictors. For "reliable" predictors and prediction models, one downgrade was permitted for risk of bias, but none for inconsistency, imprecision, or indirectness, and the overall quality of evidence had to be high or moderate. "Reliable" prediction models were required to demonstrate an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of > 0.8, and no evidence of miscalibration in external validation studies that reported calibration. Single downgrades within each of the domains of risk of bias, imprecision, and indirectness were permitted for "moderately reliable" predictors, but a downgrade for inconsistency was not. In addition, "moderately reliable" prediction models were required to demonstrate an AUC > 0.7, and some miscalibration in some external populations was allowed, given the lower risk of withdrawal of life support in this disease. Predictors that did not fit "reliable" or "moderately reliable" criteria were classified as "not reliable".

- **Balance of desirable and undesirable consequences**: Accurate prognostication of functional outcomes after acute tSCI supports the ability of patients, families, and clinicians to plan for future needs and to better focus rehabilitation activities on recovery of function versus adaptation.
