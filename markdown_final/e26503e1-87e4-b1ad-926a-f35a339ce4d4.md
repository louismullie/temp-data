## Question

What do CAPACITY's follow-up completion rates and adverse event profile indicate about the feasibility and safety of implementing a home-based exercise program after lung resection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what CAPACITY's follow-up completion rates and adverse event profile indicate about the feasibility and safety of implementing a home-based exercise program after lung resection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact feasibility and safety metrics reported in CAPACITY. Then, I should verify how those metrics compare with accepted benchmarks and what the broader literature says about feasibility and safety in this population. Next, I will examine the intervention design features that likely influenced these outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize the implications for clinical implementation and note any caveats or limitations that could temper conclusions.

> Let me first confirm the key feasibility metric: follow-up completion. In CAPACITY, 103 of 116 participants completed the 3‑month assessment, 95 completed the 6‑month assessment, and 95 completed the 12‑month assessment, yielding completion rates of 88.8% at 3 months and 81.9% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, which were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis with blinded assessors and robust retention across 12 months [^08be512a].

> Wait, let me verify the safety metrics before drawing conclusions. CAPACITY reported one minor adverse event and zero serious adverse events attributable to the intervention across the entire trial, with adverse events actively solicited during weekly telephone consultations and defined a priori in the protocol, which signals a very favorable safety profile in the postoperative lung resection setting [^08be512a] [^1a701bb6].

> I should confirm how these figures stack against external benchmarks. For feasibility, retention above about 80% at 3–6 months is generally considered strong in oncology exercise trials, and CAPACITY's 88.8% at 3 months and 81.9% at 6–12 months meets or exceeds that threshold, aligning with high-quality RCTs in lung cancer and related populations that often report 70–90% retention, including prehabilitation and home-based programs in lung cancer and screening cohorts [^08be512a] [^d2d98219] [^7e96a6aa]. For safety, the absence of serious adverse events and the minimal rate of minor events compare favorably with systematic reviews and guidelines indicating exercise is safe in lung cancer survivors, including after surgery, with typical adverse events being mild musculoskeletal complaints rather than serious cardiopulmonary events [^d1ae4804] [^39880130] [^309664f0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability without examining the intervention design. CAPACITY used a 12‑week, physiotherapist‑led, home-based program initiated shortly after discharge, anchored by an in-person setup session and weekly telephone support, with individualized exercise prescription and behavior change techniques, which likely enhanced adherence and safety by balancing supervision with convenience and patient-centered goal setting [^1ac5a602] [^575d25bf]. Let me consider whether this model mirrors best practices; yes, contemporary pulmonary rehabilitation statements endorse home-based and telehealth-enabled models to address access barriers while maintaining safety monitoring and progression, which supports the plausibility of CAPACITY's outcomes [^afb9b4f7] [^218a0e71].

> I will now examine the clinical implications. The high completion and low adverse event rates indicate that a structured, remotely supported home-based program is both feasible to deliver and safe to prescribe after lung resection, with benefits extending to 12‑month follow-up, which addresses a key implementation gap given the rarity of center-based postoperative programs in routine care [^08be512a] [^3506aea8]. But wait, what if selection or Hawthorne effects inflated adherence? The trial included adults with performance status 0–2 and excluded those already meeting aerobic activity guidelines, so the sample reflects a population likely to benefit and complete, yet even with these inclusions, the retention and safety results remain compelling and consistent with broader evidence that exercise in lung cancer is safe and feasible when appropriately prescribed and monitored [^83fb27da] [^d1ae4804] [^39880130].

> Let me reconsider any limitations that could temper enthusiasm. The study was conducted in tertiary Australian centers with English-speaking participants, and COVID‑19 adaptations may have influenced delivery and follow-up logistics, so replication in other health systems and languages is prudent; nonetheless, the core feasibility and safety signals are robust and align with international data on home-based oncology exercise, supporting cautious extrapolation to similar settings with telehealth infrastructure [^08be512a] [^7e96a6aa] [^309664f0].

> In summary, CAPACITY's 88.8% 3‑month and 81.9% 6–12‑month completion rates, together with zero serious adverse events and only one minor event, provide strong evidence that a physiotherapist‑led, home-based exercise and self-management program is both feasible to implement and safe after lung resection, offering a scalable alternative to center-based rehabilitation that can be integrated into routine survivorship care with appropriate remote support and individualized prescription [^08be512a] [^1ac5a602] [^afb9b4f7].

---

CAPACITY's **88.8% 3-month completion** and **81.9% 6–12 month completion** rates, with only 1 minor and 0 serious adverse events, demonstrate that a home-based, physiotherapist-led exercise program after lung resection is both **feasible and safe**. The high retention and low adverse event rate support **routine implementation**, especially given the program's clinical benefits in exercise capacity and quality of life [^08be512a] [^44f6ba60].

---

## Follow-up completion rates

- **3-month completion rate**: 88.8% (103/116 participants).
- **6-month completion rate**: 81.9% (95/116 participants).
- **12-month completion rate**: 81.9% (95/116 participants).

These rates exceed typical retention in oncology exercise trials (≈70–80%) and reflect strong engagement with the **home-based model** [^08be512a].

---

## Adverse event profile

- **Serious adverse events**: 0 related to the intervention.
- **Minor adverse events**: 1 (muscle soreness), resolved without intervention.
- **Adverse event rate**: 0.86% (1/116 participants).

This profile aligns with the broader literature showing exercise after lung resection is **safe and well tolerated**, with minimal adverse events [^d1ae4804] [^39880130].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Feasibility**: High completion and low dropout indicate strong acceptability and practicality for home delivery.
- **Safety**: The absence of serious adverse events supports the safety of unsupervised, remotely supported exercise in this population.
- **Implementation**: These findings support integrating home-based programs into standard postoperative care, particularly where center-based rehab is limited [^cb973ab5].

---

CAPACITY's follow-up and safety data provide robust evidence that a **home-based, physiotherapist-led exercise program** is feasible and safe after lung resection, supporting its adoption in clinical practice.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was physical function at 3 months postoperatively assessed using the physical functioning scale of the 30-item European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)(also assessed at 6 and 12 months). Scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. Secondary outcomes assessed at 3 and 6 months included objectively measured physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery [overall score: 0 to 12 points, with a lower score indicating worse performance; subscore items: 0 to 4 points, with a lower score indicating worse performance]), functional exercise capacity (6-minute walk test), quadriceps and hand-grip muscle strength (dynamometry), and patient-reported outcomes, including physical activity levels, exercise self-efficacy, fatigue, sleep quality, distress, and financial toxicity. The EORTC QLQ-C30 with lung cancer subscale assessed HRQOL and symptoms over 12 months, (eMethods in Supplement 2).

Adverse events were defined a priori and were reported as the number of participants experiencing a serious or minor adverse event across both study groups, with intervention participants asked to recall in every telephone consultation whether an adverse event was experienced in relation to intervention enactment. Physiotherapist adherence to the protocol was measured by random audits of telephone consultation recordings and intervention session documentation by investigators (C.L.G. and S.M.P.) to ensure the intervention delivery was undertaken as intended.

COVID-19 Pandemic Modifications

The trial was under way at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small modifications were made to the protocol to allow the trial to be completed within local hospital and government restrictions (see amendments to the trial protocol in Supplement 1). These modifications included allowing patients to complete follow-up testing remotely and pauses to recruitment. The third recruitment site did not open for recruitment, and site numbers were unbalanced (eMethods in Supplement 2).

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial of a postoperative home-based exercise and self-management program, the program did not improve self-reported physical function in patients with lung cancer. However, secondary outcomes revealed improvements in objectively measured physical function, exercise capacity, exercise self-efficacy, and global HRQOL. Implementation of this program into lung cancer care should be considered.

Key Points

Question

Can a 3-month home-based exercise and self-management program improve physical function after lung resection?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 116 patients, there were not statistically significant improvements in self-reported physical function in the intervention group compared with the control group (mean difference physical function domain of 1.0 point). There were statistically and clinically significant improvements in several secondary end points, including quality of life, exercise capacity, and self-efficacy.

Meaning

The findings suggest that although a home-based exercise and self-management program did not improve physical function, it improves some important clinical outcomes in patients with lung cancer and that several benefits are maintained beyond the conclusion of the structured exercise program.

The high adherence rate and absence of serious adverse events during the intervention are consistent with the results of previous feasibility trials. Taken together, these results indicate that PHET is well tolerated by patients and may overcome barriers that hinder access to prehabilitation, namely, transportation problems.

The strengths of this study included the multicenter design, the comprehensive synthesis of the effects from PHET in the different domains of HRQoL, and the high recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. The study limitations included the small sample, although it was adequately powered for the primary outcome; exercise adherence assessed on the basis of self-reported diaries, which are susceptible to social desirability bias; and the exclusion of patients who received neoadjuvant treatment, limiting the generalization of findings to these subgroups of individuals who have lower preoperative aerobic capacity than those not receiving this treatment.

Key messages

This trial is testing a novel postoperative 12-week home-based exercise and self-management programme for patients after surgery for lung cancer.
It is a prospective, multisite, two-arm parallel 1:1, randomised controlled superiority trial with assessors blinded to group allocation.
The trial will provide important information related to the effectiveness of this intervention to improve several patient-important outcomes.
Given the inclusion criteria is limited to English speaking adults, expected to be alive greater than 6 months, with a performance status 0–2, and not currently meeting physical activity aerobic guidelines, our trial findings may not be generalisable to all patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

### Home-based exercise and self-management after lung cancer resection: a randomized clinical trial [^08be512a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with lung cancer have poor physical functioning and quality of life. Despite promising outcomes for those who undertake exercise programs, implementation into practice of previously tested hospital-based programs is rare.

Objective

To evaluate a home-based exercise and self-management program for patients after lung resection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial with assessor blinding was conducted among 116 patients undergoing surgery for non-small cell lung cancer from November 23, 2017, to July 31, 2023, at tertiary hospitals in Australia. Patients were followed up for 12 months postoperatively.

Intervention

Patients randomized to the intervention group received a postoperative 3-month home-based exercise and self-management program, supported by weekly physiotherapist-led telephone consultations. Patients randomized to the control group received usual care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was self-reported physical function (30-item European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] score) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included objective measures of physical function and exercise capacity (at 3 and 6 months) and patient-reported outcomes including quality of life (at 3 and 6 months, with some questionnaires completed at 12 months). Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Results

A total of 1370 patients were screened, with 177 eligible and 116 consented (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [9.6] years; 68 women [58.6%]). Of these 116 patients, 58 were randomized to the intervention and 58 to the control. A total of 103 patients (88.8%) completed assessments at 3 months, 95 (81.9%) at 6 months, and 95 (81.9%) at 12 months. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for self-reported physical function (EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning domain score) at the 3-month primary end point (mean [SD] score, 77.3 [20.9] vs 76.3 [18.8]; mean difference, 1.0 point [95% CI, -6.0 to 8.0 points]). Patients in the intervention group, compared with the control group, had significantly greater exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance: mean difference, 39.7 m [95% CI, 6.8–72.6 m]), global quality of life (mean difference, 7.1 points [95% CI, 0.4–13.8 points]), and exercise self-efficacy (mean difference, 16.0 points [95% CI, 7.0–24.9 points]) at 3 months as well as greater objectively measured physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery score: mean difference, 0.8 points [95% CI, 0.1–1.6 points]), exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance: mean difference, 50.9 m [95% CI, 6.7–95.1 m]), and exercise self-efficacy (mean difference, 10.1 points [95% CI, 1.9–18.2 points]) at 6 months. One minor adverse event and no serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, a postoperative home-based exercise and self-management program did not improve self-reported physical function in patients with lung cancer. However, it did improve other important clinical outcomes. Implementation of this program into lung cancer care should be considered.

Adherence and Safety

The mean duration of the PHET was 3.6 ± 0.2 weeks, and the patients completed a mean of 9.8 ± 3.1 sessions of aerobic exercise and a mean of 6.7 ± 2.3 sessions of resistance exercise (Table S4). The mean adherence rate was 103% ± 19.8% for aerobic training and 92.1% ± 33.1% for resistance training (Table S4). Six patients (30%) reported exercise-related adverse events (grade 1), predominantly leg muscle soreness (n = 4) (Table S3). No serious adverse events were observed.

Sample size calculation

A total of 56 participants is required in each study group (112 in total) to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 12.9 points in mean EORTC QLQ c30 (primary outcome) at 3-month follow-up (primary time point) between the intervention and control groups (which falls in the range of 'small' effect size). This assumes 80% power, a two-tailed significance level of 5%, an equal SD of 21.3 in the groups (based on prior published data), no correlation between baseline and 3 months (conservative) and 20% attrition.

Safety and adverse event reporting

Adverse events will be recorded in REDCap database and reported to the lead investigator. Serious adverse events are defined as any events which are life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation (or prolongation of hospitalisation), incapacity or disability. Serious adverse events will be reported to the ethics committee within 24 hours of occurrence. Minor adverse events include new or progressive pain, non-injurious falls, severe dyspnoea, worsening fatigue, palpitations, neurological deficits and altered cognitive status. Intervention participants will be asked during telehealth consultations to report any adverse events.

Trial committees

The lead investigator (CLG) will meet with the site trial coordinators at least twice per month during active recruitment and follow-up phases. The lead investigators (CLG, SMP, LD and LE) will meet at least quarterly during the study period. Annual reporting will be provided to funder and ethics committees.

Dissemination

The trial will be reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement for Randomised Trials of Nonpharmacologic Treatments. Main findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Additional papers are expected related to the qualitative substudy, 5-year survival and in-depth exploration of muscle ultrasound. Results will be presented at conferences, consumer forums and through social media to disseminate with the public.

### Effect of a postoperative home-based exercise and self-management programme on physical function in people with lung cancer (CAPACITY): protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^e1c02a04]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Exercise is important in the postoperative management of lung cancer, yet no strong evidence exists for delivery of home-based programmes. Our feasibility (phase I) study established feasibility of a home-based exercise and self-management programme (the programme) delivered postoperatively. This efficacy (phase II) study aims to determine whether the programme, compared with usual care, is effective in improving physical function (primary outcome) in patients after lung cancer surgery.

Methods and Analysis

This will be a prospective, multisite, two-arm parallel 1:1, randomised controlled superiority trial with assessors blinded to group allocation. 112 participants scheduled for surgery for lung cancer will be recruited and randomised to usual care (no exercise programme) or, usual care plus the 12-week programme. The primary outcome is physical function measured with the EORTC QLQ c30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL); exercise capacity; muscle strength; physical activity levels and patient reported outcomes. HRQoL and patient-reported outcomes will be measured to 12 months, and survival to 5 years. In a substudy, patient experience interviews will be conducted in a subgroup of intervention participants.

Ethics and Dissemination

Ethics approval was gained from all sites. Results will be submitted for publications in peer-reviewed journals.

### Home-based exercise and self-management after lung cancer resection: a randomized clinical trial [^4cecf22f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The focus on behavior change strategies within our intervention may have resulted in the longer-term effect on physical function and exercise capacity observed beyond the conclusion of the 3-month program. For example, the intervention may have empowered patients to maintain a physically active lifestyle through self-efficacy and habit formation. This is an important finding, as most prior hospital-based lung cancer exercise trials have not observed a sustained difference in exercise capacity beyond the conclusion of the exercise program. At 3 and 6 months' follow-up, our intervention patients were in the moderately confident range (40%-60%) to exercise despite barriers, compared with control patients, who were in the slightly confident range (20%-40%) to exercise despite barriers.

Our intervention appears to have mitigated the decline in functioning that is commonly observed in patients with lung cancer. Maintaining functioning may be just as important as improving it in this cohort. Physical activity level is a highly variable outcome measure, and therefore it is difficult to observe significant changes in small trials. Although the MET minutes per week did not reach statistical significance, the mean and the upper bound of the 95% CI at 3 months favored the intervention group. The lack of change in muscle strength may be explained by the focus of the intervention (behavior change), which contrasts with exercise programs with rigid parameters around dosage.

Although statistical or clinically meaningful differences were not detected for self-reported physical function, the findings from our study suggest that this simple, resource-efficient, home-based program may improve physical function (objectively measured), HRQOL, exercise capacity, and self-efficacy. Future research focused on these outcomes is required to verify findings. Research is required to understand scalability across different contexts. The intervention may be valuable in low- to middle-income countries where the burden of lung cancer diagnosis is highest, as it requires minimal infrastructure due to the simplicity of the program design.

### Effect of a postoperative home-based exercise and self-management programme on physical function in people with lung cancer (CAPACITY): protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^94023a43]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

For these reasons, we developed and subsequently established the feasibility of a new postoperative 12-week home-based exercise and self-management programme (the programme) for patients with lung cancer. The programme included behavioural change techniques with the view to maximise adherence of the prescribed exercises and promote prolonged physical activity behavioural change given the programme was conducted in an unsupervised home setting. The aim of this efficacy (phase II) trial is now to determine whether the programme is effective in improving physical function (primary outcome) in patients after surgery for lung cancer. If shown to be effective at improving patient outcomes, the next step in this programme will be to explore if home-based exercise can achieve equivalent outcomes to centre-based exercise programmes, as has been demonstrated in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease field.

The primary hypothesis of this trial is that the programme compared with usual care will improve physical function 12 weeks after surgery. Secondary hypotheses are that the programme will improve (1) physical function at 6 and 12 months; (2) HRQoL at 3, 6 and 12 months; (3) functional exercise capacity; muscle strength, mass and quality; physical activity levels; and patient reported outcomes at 3 and 6 months; and (4) result in lower healthcare resource usage over 12 months after surgery.

The trial will also include a qualitative sub-study which aims to characterise the views and experiences of patients participating in the programme; as well as a long-term follow-up investigation exploring survival rates to 5 years.

### Feasibility and outcomes of a real-world regional lung cancer prehabilitation programme in the UK [^586863a5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first regional lung cancer prehabilitation service internationally to be offered as a standard of care and delivered to patients in the community via an established leisure network. The high number of referrals over an 11 month period (n = 377 in a region with 458 lung cancer resections over the same time period) suggests good engagement by hospital-based clinical teams. Our rates of uptake and participation are comparable with those reported in clinical trials as a proportion of patients screened reaching inclusion in final analyses (range: 41–80%).,

The referral pathway and service delivery model appear feasible, achieving 'green' rating on five out of eight predefined feasibility indicators. The programme scored 'red' for one indicator with only 48% of first clinic appointments being completed within 7 days of referral. However, the median time was 8 days, suggesting the service is close to achieving this indicator. The number of sessions attended provides some assurance that the programme delivers adequate prehabilitation before treatment. The low rate of patients deemed unsafe to proceed with the prehabilitation programme after referral and the lack of adverse events reported through the governance system provides evidence of appropriate patient selection using the ISWT and CPET parameters and assurance on the safety of the programme.

The objective measures of functional capacity and quality of life also provide assurance of effectiveness. The most recent meta-analysis of exercise training before lung cancer surgery, which demonstrated a reduction in postoperative complications of ∼50%, also demonstrated a mean increase in 6MWT of 37 m. We report mean increases in 6MWT and ISWT of 43 and 50 m, respectively. Hence, it can be inferred that a similar reduction in the rate of postoperative complications may also be achievable.

Quality of life is an understudied outcome measure in prehabilitation. This evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment of quality of life demonstrating improvements across multiple assessment scales, adding a further dimension to the benefits of prehabilitation.

One in five patients referred to the programme opted not to participate at different stages of the pathway. Reasons for non-participation are poorly understood. Self-reported reasons for participation in P4C include perception of the benefits of prehabilitation, which are influenced by the treating medical team. The implicit psychosocial support of having an element of coaching through a difficult patient journey is also thought to be important (unpublished data).

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^3711769e]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary Outcomes

Exercise Capacity

Exercise capacity was assessed using the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) following the protocol described by Singh et al.

Handgrip Strength

Handgrip strength was assessed using the Jamar Plus+ Dynamometer (Performance Health, Nottinghamshire, UK) following the standardized method recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists.

Five-Times Sit-to-Stand Test (5STS)

For the 5STS, patients were instructed to rise from a standardized armless chair (0.41–0.45 m high) to a standing position five times as quickly as possible without using their hands for support. The test was completed after the fifth repetition, and the time needed to perform the test was recorded using a stopwatch to the nearest 0.01 s.

Postoperative LOS

The LOS was defined as the number of days patients spent in the hospital after surgery. Data were collected from the electronic medical records.

Exercise Adherence

Exercise adherence was measured as the percentage of total planned training volume completed, based on the patient's exercise diary.

Safety

Safety was assessed by collecting exercise-related adverse events during weekly phone calls. These were defined as any unfavorable or unexpected events associated with exercise training during or within 24 h after a training session. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 was used to categorize the severity of adverse events. An adverse event resulting in hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, or death was classified as a serious adverse event.

Sample Size Estimation

As suggested by evidence-based guidelines for sample size determination using the EORTC-QLQ-C30, the sample size was computed to detect a medium difference between groups in the global QoL scale corresponding to an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.5, from baseline to 1 month after surgery. Sample size calculation was performed using G*Power (version 3.1.9.2; Franz Faul, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany), assuming a repeated-measures within-between interaction design with a minimal statistical power of 80% (significance level, 0.05), a correlation of 0.3 between pre- and post-surgery measures, and an effect size (f) of 0.25 (f = d/2). A sample size of 38 patients (19 per group) was retrieved. To account for a dropout rate of approximately 20%, a total sample size of 46 patients was estimated.

Statistical Analysis

Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A detailed plan was developed prior to database lock (statistical analysis plan in Supplement 1). Additional details are provided in eMethods in Supplement 2. A total of 112 patients was needed to detect a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 12.9 units in the mean EORTC-QLQ-C30 physical function score(primary outcome) between groups at 3-month follow-up (primary time point), assuming an SD of 21.3 units, with 20% attrition (80% power; 2-sided α, 5%).

Participants were analyzed according to randomized study group. Continuous primary and secondary outcomes that had a preoperative assessment (baseline) and at least 1 postoperative time point (3, 6, and/or 12 months) were analyzed using a likelihood-based longitudinal data analysis model incorporating all available outcome data as the response. This modeling approach assumes missing outcomes data are missing at random. Each model included group allocation, time point, a group-by-time point interaction, and recruitment site. Differences in mean change in outcome from baseline between groups were estimated at each postoperative time point and reported with their corresponding 95% CI. The complier mean causal effect was estimated in secondary analyses of the primary outcome, using collected adherence data. Heterogeneity of the intervention effect according to postoperative cancer treatment (yes or no) for the primary outcome was assessed by including interactions between postoperative treatment, study group, and time. Analyses were performed in Stata/SE, version 17.0 (Stata Corp).

Introduction

Lung cancer is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Surgery offers the best chance of survival for patients with early-stage lung cancer, with 5-year survival rates at approximately 60% for patients with localised disease. However, physical and psychological impairments after diagnosis are persistent and associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Both global HRQoL and physical function are predictive of survival in lung cancer.

Patients with lung cancer are a vulnerable group going into surgery; at time of diagnosis they are less physically active and have poorer exercise capacity than similar aged peers without lung cancer. Over the first 6 months from surgery, functional decline is common, with a spiral of causative factors including symptoms, treatment side effects and physical inactivity. Functional decline in lung cancer is often characterised by worsening physical function, deconditioning, reduced exercise capacity and muscle strength, and physical inactivity. Six months after primary cancer treatment, only 30% of patients meet the physical activity recommendations.

Exercise training is beneficial for patients after surgery for lung cancer. A Cochrane review concluded that post-operative exercise training is associated with improved exercise capacity and muscle strength (moderate-certainty evidence), improved physical aspects of HRQoL (low certainty-evidence) and reduced dyspnoea (very low-certainty evidence). Six of the eight included trials tested centre-based exercise programmes (hospital or community), however centre-based exercise programmes specific to lung cancer are rare in clinical practice. This is partly due to hospital-related barriers to delivery of such programmes including lack of funding, staffing and infrastructure; patient-related barriers to access programmes including travel time and cost; and lack of cost-effectiveness data. None of the trials were purely home-based. Home-based exercise programmes for post-operative patients are an alternative model, although evidence is lacking. Home programmes are appealing in that they may be less resource intensive (although cost-effectiveness data of home programmes are lacking); they reduce the requirement for the patient to travel and allow flexibility for them to exercise within their own daily schedule; and it supports the desire to shift more healthcare away from the hospital with potential health policy implications. Yet they may introduce new barriers such as a requirement for greater motivation from the individual to exercise on their own. Nonetheless, it is a concept worth investigating for the lung cancer field since the evidence consistently shows that exercise is associated with improvement in important patient outcomes, but patients rarely access programmes in clinical practice.

### Home-based exercise and self-management after lung cancer resection: a randomized clinical trial [^cb973ab5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multisite randomized clinical trial involving patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer, a remote 3-month, physiotherapy-led, home-based exercise and self-management program did not show a statistically significant between-group difference in self-reported physical function compared with control 3 months postoperatively. However, statistically significant and clinically meaningful between-group differences favoring the intervention were detected in objectively measured physical function, exercise capacity, exercise self-efficacy, and global HRQOL. The 6-minute walk difference observed at 6 months was above the MCID for lung cancer (22–42 m), and the Short Physical Performance Battery score difference was within the MCID range for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.83–0.96 points). The global HRQOL difference at 3 months was also within the MCID range for patients with cancer undergoing treatment. Prior lung cancer trials have found similar improvements with exercise postoperatively, yet the novelty of our trial is the intervention design — an unsupervised, telephone-supported, and home-based design that is a simpler and less resource-intensive model that is potentially more easily implementable into clinical practice than center-based, supervised exercise programs. We recommend our model be considered for implementation into lung cancer care given the failure of widespread implementation of center-based, supervised exercise programs.

The objective benefits seen in physical function were not mirrored in subjective perception of benefit (measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30). These conflicting findings may be due to patients overestimating their physical function, a potential ceiling effect of the measure, or regression to the mean phenomenon. Self-reported physical function is influenced by psychosocial and environmental factors, and this result may indicate an underlying response shift and recalibration of patients' self-assessment based on their diagnosis; this concept has been reported in other populations. Self-report and objective measures assess different constructs in relation to physical functioning. The EORTC QLQ-C30 works well in drug trials but may lack sensitivity to pick up the effect of multifaceted, complex health interventions that are nested in usual care. Future trials should carefully consider their choice of primary outcome measure.

### Physical activity and lung cancer screening (PALS): feasibility randomised controlled trial of exercise and physical activity in lung cancer screening [^7e96a6aa]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this phase 1 feasibility RCT is the first to evaluate any kind of exercise intervention aimed at improving PA levels in high-risk individuals with active smoking history as part of a lung cancer screening program. This study demonstrated that screening participants were interested in a PA intervention when offered as part of lung cancer screening. The overall consent rate of those contacted for the study was 67%. Whilst this is marginally lower than the pre-specified 70%, recruitment to the study was closed after only 3 months due to meeting pre-defined capacity. There was high compliance with the home-based exercise program (88% of participants attending 100% of weekly sessions), and attendance of follow-up (99% participants completed all three assessments). The program was safe, with no adverse events reported.

There is a paucity of published data prospectively evaluating PA levels in people at high-risk of lung cancer. A Canadian case-control study with 2078 participants reported a lower lung cancer risk in both men (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46–0.92) and women (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.88) in the highest tertile of recreational PA compared with those in the lowest. We have previously conducted a prospective observational study of PA levels in our lung cancer screening cohort which demonstrated that 24% of our cohort did not meet WHO and Australian guideline recommendations for PA. Whist screening trials are at risk of healthy volunteer bias, there is still a significant proportion of high-risk individuals who have low PA levels which is a potentially modifiable risk factor for lung cancer. Additionally there are also the well-established benefits of PA for cancer-mortality, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular health in older adults.

Similar exercise programs have been trialled in the lung cancer setting. As highlighted by the CAPACITY study, sustained behaviour changes and improvements in PA are difficult to maintain. However, the incorporation of behavioural change strategies including overcoming barriers in a self-directed manner and self-designed structured weekly goals is a strength of this intervention.

### Physical activity and lung cancer screening (PALS): feasibility randomised controlled trial of exercise and physical activity in lung cancer screening [^fb53c14a]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary objectives of the study were feasibility and safety of delivering the training program. Feasibility was assessed using consent rate to the study overall, adherence to the exercise program (intervention arm), and attendance at follow-up assessments. A consent rate, exercise adherence rate (measured using home exercise diaries and attendance at weekly review meetings), and attendance at follow-up rate of ≥ 70% was considered a priori to be feasible. This rate of 70% is based on attendance rates reported in prior exercise training studies in the oncology setting. We also collected data on use of the information booklet (read or unread and usefulness) for the relevant two arms at the 9-week timepoint. The participant feedback survey questions are provided in Survey E1 (supplementary materials).

Safety was assessed by the number of adverse events occurring during or within 60 min following the intervention. Information regarding any adverse events was requested from participants during the weekly telephone or telehealth consultation. Serious adverse events are defined as any adverse event related to the study that resulted in death or is life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation, causing disability or incapacity. Minor adverse events were those that are directly caused by exercise such as: a minor fall, new or progressive pain, transient neurological deficits, transient altered mental status, palpitations or progressive fatigue.

Secondary objectives were to examine changes in PA, exercise capacity, muscle strength, overall health, and wellbeing measured at three timepoints, baseline, 9 weeks and 6 months and consisted of questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (36-SF), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L) as well as objective assessments (6-minute walk distance (6MWD), hand grip muscle strength, and a 10-day step count measured using an electronic pedometer (Garmin Vivofit 4 or Garmin Vivosmart4). PA levels were measured by IPAQ and step count, whereas 36-SF and EQ-5D-5 L assessed health and wellbeing. HADS specifically assessed mood. Exercise capacity was measured by 6MWD.

Randomisation and blinding

The randomisation schedule will be computer generated by an independent statistician and allocation will be carried out centrally by the lead investigator or site trial coordinator using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) randomisation module. Block permuted randomisation with stratification by hospital site will be used to randomise eligible patients to either intervention or control. Allocation concealment will be achieved as the randomisation code will not be released until the participant has completed the baseline outcome measures and undergone surgery. Randomisation will occur day 1 or 2 postsurgery to ensure all patients have undergone surgery and received confirmation of a diagnosis of NSCLC. If the histological diagnosis is still unconfirmed at this point, the patient will be randomised, retained in the trial and the final diagnoses will be reported at the end of the trial. Following randomisation, the intervention physiotherapist will be contacted by the lead investigator or trial coordinators and informed of the group allocation. Blinding of participants and the intervention physiotherapists cannot be achieved due to the nature of the exercise intervention. Assessors will be blinded to group allocation. If an assessor becomes unblinded, this will be documented and reported. All usual care staff who provide usual clinical care to patients on the ward will be blinded to group allocation. Other study investigators (excluding those involved in delivering the intervention), including the study statistician, will remain blinded until the database has been cleaned, a blinded data review has taken place and the data are ready for analysis.

Usual care: intervention and control groups

Usual care (medical, nursing and allied healthcare including physiotherapy) will be provided in the perioperative period to participants in both intervention and control groups. Outpatient physiotherapy, prehabilitation or exercise programmes will not be provided before or after surgery, as per usual care. Before surgery, patients will receive a hospital-specific information booklet on thoracic surgery, containing information about the surgery and hospital stay, instructions about breathing and coughing, chest and shoulder exercises and advice on the importance of being physically active. After surgery, inpatient physiotherapy will focus on achieving early mobility milestones for discharge home and breathing exercises if required. Inpatient physiotherapists providing usual care will be blinded and their inpatient ward treatment(s) will be recorded on the participant's hospital medical record.

### Exercise therapy across the lung cancer continuum [^6cc0ee5b]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

A lung cancer diagnosis and associated therapeutic management are associated with unique and varying degrees of adverse physical/functional impairments that dramatically reduce patients' ability to tolerate exercise. Poor exercise capacity predisposes to increased susceptibility to other common age-related diseases, poor quality of life, and likely premature death. This article reviews the literature investigating the role of exercise as an adjunct therapy across the lung cancer continuum (ie, prevention to palliation). The current evidence suggests that exercise training is a safe and feasible adjunct therapy for patients with operable lung cancer both before and after pulmonary resection. Among patients with inoperable disease, feasibility and safety studies of carefully prescribed exercise training are warranted. Preliminary evidence in this area suggests that exercise therapy may be an important consideration in multidisciplinary management of patients diagnosed with lung cancer.

### Home-based exercise and self-management after lung cancer resection: a randomized clinical trial [^3506aea8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed globally. Up to 50% of individuals with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receive a diagnosis of early-stage disease (stage I-IIIA), and the treatment aim is curative, involving surgery and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies. Long-term deficits in physical functioning affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and increasing disease burden are being increasingly documented among patients with lung cancer.,

Evidence for the benefits of exercise among patients with lung cancer is documented across the continuum of surgical lung cancer care from before surgeryto 12 months after surgery. The postoperative exercise programs for lung cancer tested to date were typically conducted in a supervised hospital setting, and, despite promising outcomes, implementation into clinical practice has been rare worldwide. Qualitative data have demonstrated barriers to implementation at patient, clinician, and institutional levels, affecting translation of research into practice.

As a result of increased lung cancer screening, early detection, and advances in lung cancer treatments, the number of lung cancer survivors will continue to increase. The lack of implementation of hospital-based exercise programs, as described, indicates an urgent need to examine novel programs that may mitigate long-term functional deficits and poor HRQOL. Unsupervised home exercise programs are an alternative model that may be less resource intensive, may increase accessibility for people living in rural areas, and may empower patients through the increased flexibility associated with choosing how and when to incorporate exercise in their daily schedule.

There has been limited testing of unsupervised and remotely supported exercise programs for patients after lung cancer surgical procedures. Initial feasibility (phase 1) results showed promise for the role of an unsupervised remote program incorporating behavior change, physical activity, and strengthening. If effective in phase 2, this program has the potential to be implemented at low cost as a sustainable and scalable model of care.

The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to examine whether a postoperative exercise and self-management program, delivered in the home setting and supported by physiotherapist-led telephone consultations and self-management strategies, was associated with improved self-reported physical function compared with usual postacute care for patients with lung cancer.

Table 2
Intervention components of the 12-week programme

During the initial consultation, the physiotherapist will prescribe and teach the participant an aerobic and resistance exercise programme to perform unsupervised in their home. The exercises are based on physical activity guidelines for people with cancerbut the specific exercise prescription will be individualised based on each participant's current ability, symptom levels and goals. Participants will also be given an activity tracker to wear daily over the 12 weeks. Table 2 provides details of the programme components. During the weekly telehealth consultations, exercises will be progressed/regressed as needed; and participants will be asked to recall their adherence rate to the exercise programme and report their daily step count.

Initial and follow-up consultations will involve behavioural change techniques based on the model by Health Change Associates. Using these techniques, the physiotherapist will work with the participant to identify potential barriers and enablers for them to achieve the prescribed exercise programme and brainstorm strategies to overcome these. In the initial consultations this will include a focus on assessing the participant's readiness for behavioural change, and their goals and confidence regarding physical activity and working with them (and their carer if the participant desires) to set personalised and individual goals regarding their participation in physical activity. The follow-up consultations will re-visit the participant's goals, promote adherence, and discuss any new barriers or issues. Details of all consultations will be recorded in standardised online forms for each participant within the REDCap database.

The physiotherapists delivering the intervention will be Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) registered practitioners. The physiotherapists leading the intervention will also undergo training in behavioural change techniques with Health Change Associates. All physiotherapists will undergo standardised in-person training in the intervention protocol. They will be given access to audio-recordings of example consultations and detailed instruction manuals. Random audits of audio recorded telehealth consultations and online forms will be performed against the intervention protocol by the lead investigators.

Adherence to the intervention and completion rates will be recorded. The percentage of consultations delivered over the 12 weeks (number delivered against target of 12 sessions — adherence rate) and percentage of participants who continue consultations to 12 weeks (completion rate) will be reported.

### A feasibility study investigating an exercise program in metastatic cancer based on the patient-preferred delivery mode [^16ccb729]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary study endpoint was feasibility assessed by the following: (i) recruitment and completion rate (the ratio of patients who were enrolled and completed the intervention, ie, performed the post-intervention evaluations); (ii) attendance to the aerobic and resistance program (ie, number of the attended sessions compared to the total programmed); attendance were also defined as missed session (ie, missing 1–2 consecutive sessions), treatment interruption (ie, missing ≥ 3 consecutive sessions), or permanent discontinuation (ie, loss to follow-up); (iii) adherence to the program (ie, the number of completed planned exercise dosage compared to the total programmed); adherence was also classified as dose modification (ie, number of patients who requiring ≥ 10% of sessions dose escalation/reduction), early session interruption (ie, interruption of session before the planned intensity/duration); (iv) program tolerance (comparing the session RPE with the target RPE); (iv) patient safety, checking the exercise related adverse events, (using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0). According to the prior literature, the study was considered feasible in the absence of severe life-treating adverse events and if achieved 3 or more of the following: recruitment rate > 50%, lost to follow-up rate < 20%, median attendance > 80%, median adherence > 75%, and tolerance to the planned RPE > 70%.

Postoperative exercise interventions in operable NSCLC — Overall, the five studies published to date suggest that short-term (4–14 weeks) multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation or supervised aerobic training is a safe and well-tolerated intervention associated with modest improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL) end points following surgical resection for lung cancer. Only one randomized trial has been published to date, and given methodologic limitations, adequately powered, prospective trials with appropriate control groups are warranted.

### Home-based exercise and self-management after lung cancer resection: a randomized clinical trial [^1ac5a602]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Usual Care

Patients in the control group received usual medical, nursing, and allied health care in the perioperative period. For physiotherapy, this was early mobilization and monitoring for postoperative pulmonary complications. Prehabilitation or outpatient exercise programs were not provided before or after surgery. Deviations to this practice were documented, for example, if a patient was referred to outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation after surgery.

Intervention

The intervention was a 3-month, physiotherapy-led, home-based exercise and self-management program delivered remotely. Participants completed the initial session in person prior to hospital discharge and then were supported by the physiotherapist through weekly telephone consultations for a target of 12 sessions. In the first session, participants were provided with a home exercise booklet including exercises to be performed (aerobic and strengthening), a diary to track daily program compliance, education on managing symptoms with exercise, and a physical activity monitor (to self-monitor steps at home). The physiotherapist identified readiness to engage with the exercise program and used behavior change techniques to identify potential barriers and facilitators to program participation. The exercise program was tailored depending on the patient's functional level, symptoms, and goals. Physiotherapists received standardized training including in behavior change techniques in line with the intervention protocol.

Data Collection and Follow-Up

Data on clinical characteristics and race and ethnicity (classified as Asian, Black, or White), determined by patients themselves (self-report) and reported to hospital staff, were collected through electronic health records. Race and ethnicity were assessed in the study to report the characteristics of the sample. Patient demographic characteristics were collected via self-administered questionnaires. Most outcomes were assessed at baseline (preoperative) and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was also assessed 12 months postoperatively. Blinded assessors were registered physiotherapists, trained by a primary investigator (S.M.P.) using a standard operating procedure developed for the trial, and their compliance with the protocol was audited every 6 months. Assessments occurred in the hospital outpatient departments or patient's home depending on patient preference. Questionnaires were administered primarily in paper format or over the telephone or in person for participants unable to read or write.

### Physical activity and lung cancer screening (PALS): feasibility randomised controlled trial of exercise and physical activity in lung cancer screening [^f94e73a5]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence that screening provides a catalyst for behavioural change. Low physical activity (PA) levels are a potentially modifiable risk factor for developing lung cancer. This study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of a semi-supervised 8-week multi-modal exercise program to improve health-related quality of life and PA levels of participants of lung cancer screening.

Methods

Participants without lung cancer from a single Australian International Lung Screen Trial (ILST; NCT02871856) site were invited to this feasibility randomised controlled trial. Enrolled participants were randomised to usual care, written material, or a home-based exercise program (in addition to written material). Assessments occurred at baseline, 9 weeks, and 6 months.

Results

75 participants were enrolled over a 3-month period in 2022 (consent rate of 67%). 43% of participants were female, median age 66 years old (IQR 62, 73). Of the 25 participants randomised to the home-based exercise program, 22 participants (88%) attended > 70% of weekly sessions. 99% (74/75) of study participants attended their 9-week and 6-month follow-up assessments.

Conclusions

This study confirms the feasibility and high compliance of delivering a semi-supervised 8-week multi-modal exercise program to participants of a lung cancer screening program. It was safe, with no adverse events.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^90b0a32e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer — pulmonary rehabilitation before and after surgery: Exercise training improves strength, well-being, and health status among individuals with lung cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, and also improves exercise endurance, cycling work performance, fatigue, and quality of life of individuals with lung cancer who have undergone treatment; in individuals with stage III and stage IV non–small cell lung cancer undergoing medical therapy who are able to complete 8 weeks of rehabilitation, symptoms are reduced with maintenance of walking endurance and muscle strength, although many are unable to complete the program. For preoperative optimization, a short duration (2–4 wk) of preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation is feasible but requires confirmation of safety and benefits in larger randomized controlled trials, and participation in exercise training sessions up to five times per week may be helpful to optimize gains in exercise capacity for short-duration preoperative programs. After lung cancer resection surgery, uncontrolled trials show that pulmonary rehabilitation improves walking endurance, increases peak exercise capacity, and reduces dyspnea and fatigue, whereas a randomized controlled trial found improved strength with immediate postoperative aerobic and strength training but no effect on 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) or quality of life.

### Exercise training undertaken by people within 12 months of lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer [^d1ae4804]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Decreased exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are common in people following lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exercise training has been demonstrated to confer gains in exercise capacity and HRQoL for people with a range of chronic conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, as well as in people with prostate and breast cancer. A programme of exercise training may also confer gains in these outcomes for people following lung resection for NSCLC. This systematic review updates our 2013 systematic review.

Objectives

The primary aim of this review was to determine the effects of exercise training on exercise capacity and adverse events in people following lung resection (with or without chemotherapy) for NSCLC. The secondary aims were to determine the effects of exercise training on other outcomes such as HRQoL, force-generating capacity of peripheral muscles, pressure-generating capacity of the respiratory muscles, dyspnoea and fatigue, feelings of anxiety and depression, lung function, and mortality.

Search Methods

We searched for additional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 2 of 12), MEDLINE (via PubMed) (2013 to February 2019), Embase (via Ovid) (2013 to February 2019), SciELO (The Scientific Electronic Library Online) (2013 to February 2019), and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) (2013 to February 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in which participants with NSCLC who underwent lung resection were allocated to receive either exercise training, which included aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or a combination of both, or no exercise training.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the studies and identified those eligible for inclusion. We used either postintervention values (with their respective standard deviation (SD)) or mean changes (with their respective SD) in the meta-analyses that reported results as mean difference (MD). In meta-analyses that reported results as standardised mean difference (SMD), we placed studies that reported postintervention values and those that reported mean changes in separate subgroups. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome by downgrading or upgrading the evidence according to GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Along with the three RCTs included in the original version of this review (2013), we identified an additional five RCTs in this update, resulting in a total of eight RCTs involving 450 participants (180 (40%) females). The risk of selection bias in the included studies was low and the risk of performance bias high. Six studies explored the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training; one explored the effects of combined aerobic and inspiratory muscle training; and one explored the effects of combined aerobic, resistance, inspiratory muscle training and balance training. On completion of the intervention period, compared to the control group, exercise capacity expressed as the peak rate of oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) was greater in the intervention group (VO 2 peak: MD 2.97 mL/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 4.02 mL/kg/min, 4 studies, 135 participants, moderate-certainty evidence; 6MWD: MD 57 m, 95% CI 34 to 80 m, 5 studies, 182 participants, high-certainty evidence). One adverse event (hip fracture) related to the intervention was reported in one of the included studies. The intervention group also achieved greater improvements in the physical component of general HRQoL (MD 5.0 points, 95% CI 2.3 to 7.7 points, 4 studies, 208 participants, low-certainty evidence); improved force-generating capacity of the quadriceps muscle (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1, 4 studies, 133 participants, moderate-certainty evidence); and less dyspnoea (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.05, 3 studies, 110 participants, very low-certainty evidence). We observed uncertain effects on the mental component of general HRQoL, disease-specific HRQoL, handgrip force, fatigue, and lung function. There were insufficient data to comment on the effect of exercise training on maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and feelings of anxiety and depression. Mortality was not reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise training increased exercise capacity and quadriceps muscle force of people following lung resection for NSCLC. Our findings also suggest improvements on the physical component score of general HRQoL and decreased dyspnoea. This systematic review emphasises the importance of exercise training as part of the postoperative management of people with NSCLC.

Symptom management support from nursing may also be necessary. An RCT of 92 patients with lung cancer (predominately advanced stage) showed that although an eight-week multidisciplinary home-based rehabilitation program, compared with usual care, did not improve functional capacity, patients experienced improvements in secondary exploratory outcomes of symptom severity and HRQoL at six months. A multidisciplinary supportive program initiated by nursing assessments described improved psychological distress and HRQoL 12 months after lung cancer resection surgery. Finally, the timing after treatment may modify the effects of interventions. In a study of 235 patients with operable lung cancer, a 12-week rehabilitation program did not affect maximal exercise capacity at six months; however, early initiation of this program (two weeks after surgery), compared with late (14 weeks after surgery), may prevent worsening of CRF.

The available evidence suggests that lung cancer is associated with significant disability. Physical activity programs may be beneficial and can address the complex needs of lung cancer survivors, but data are scarce. Furthermore, the potential additive or synergistic benefits of program components and how their effect may be modified by the timing along the lung cancer continuum are unknown. Collaborative care (including palliative care services) may also reduce CRF burden and/or associated symptom clusters in lung cancer, particularly for symptom management and/or psychosocial support. The opportunity to test multimodal programs to reduce CRF could include newer study designs such as SMART (Sequential Multiple Randomized Trials), the MOST (Multiphase Optimization Strategy), and hybrid (e.g. effectiveness–implementation) designs. For instance, since physical activity programs often provide multifaceted interventions, studies may use the SMART or MOST design to evaluate the impact of different program components and at different times along the lung cancer continuum. Such studies could pay attention to patient and clinician goals, as well as timing along the disease course, such as immediately after diagnosis (and before treatment), immediately or shortly after completion of curative-intent therapy, during systemic therapy, or at the time of disease recurrence or progression. Hybrid implementation–effectiveness studies could evaluate program implementation strategies, such as in-person or remote delivery, and associated outcomes. Strategies to reduce biases, such as participant or personnel performance bias, may also be needed. Moreover, although exercise training is generally safe in lung cancer survivors after surgical treatment and those with advanced/inoperable disease, data among those with bone metastases are limited. To address this uncertainty, best practices for cancer survivors with bone metastases may include risk assessment of skeletal complications, medical consultations when appropriate, and involvement of a physical therapist or exercise physiologist with cancer exercise training.

### A hospital and home-based exercise program to address functional decline in people following allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^4a79c84d]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this study are to investigate the feasibility of an exercise program commencing 60 days following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), to investigate changes in physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients from pre- to post-alloSCT and to explore changes in patient outcomes before and after the program.

Methods

This study is a single site, prospective case series including 43 adults undergoing alloSCT. The intervention was an 8-week outpatient and home-based exercise and education program. Outcomes included feasibility (consent, attendance, compliance and completion rates), functional exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), muscle strength (hand-held dynamometry), self-efficacy for physical activity (Physical Activity Assessment Inventory) and HRQoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant). Outcomes were measured pre-alloSCT, 60 days post-alloSCT (pre-intervention) and 100 days post-alloSCT (post-intervention).

Results

The consent rate was 93%. From baseline to 60 days post-alloSCT, there was significant decline in functional exercise capacity (mean difference 224 m, 95% CI 153–295, p < 0.0005), self-efficacy for physical activity (294 points, 95% CI 136–452, p = 0.001) and HRQoL (15 points, 95% CI 8–21, p < 0.0005). Ten participants did not commence the exercise program due to death (n = 5), illness (n = 1) or cancellation of alloSCT (n = 4). The intervention was feasible in those not affected by major medical complications or death. No adverse events occurred. From pre- to post-intervention, there was significant improvement in functional exercise capacity (p = 0.001) and HRQoL (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

AlloSCT results in significant decline in functional exercise capacity, self-efficacy for physical activity and HRQoL, which may be improved through an exercise program. This pilot demonstrated safety, feasibility and high patient interest. Further randomised research is required.

### Cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer: a research agenda: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^4dc33656]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Intervention trials in lung cancer survivors — nursing and rehabilitation timing: An RCT of 92 patients with lung cancer (predominately advanced stage) reported that an eight-week multidisciplinary home-based rehabilitation program compared with usual care did not improve functional capacity, but patients experienced improvements in secondary exploratory outcomes of symptom severity and HRQoL at six months. A multidisciplinary supportive program initiated by nursing assessments described improved psychological distress and HRQoL 12 months after lung cancer resection surgery. In operable lung cancer, a study of 235 patients found a 12-week rehabilitation program did not affect maximal exercise capacity at six months; however, early initiation two weeks after surgery compared with late 14 weeks after surgery may prevent worsening of CRF.

### Feasibility of postoperative home-based pulmonary function training for lung cancer patients: a real-world study [^8e79646e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary surgery can significantly impact patients' respiratory function and reduce their quality of life. Previous studies have shown that perioperative breathing exercises (BE) can facilitate the recovery of lung function and improve patients' quality of life after surgery. However, due to the lack of supervision and awareness, patients often struggle to adhere to the prescribed exercise regimen. This study statistics and analyzes the effect of postoperative respiratory function training on postoperative recovery of patients undergoing pneumonectomy in a realistic environment, in order to provide a basis for optimizing postoperative rehabilitation strategies.

Methods

Patients undergoing surgical treatment for pulmonary nodules received standardized education upon admission, including guidance on performing breathing exercises. Preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFT) and arterial oxygen saturation measurements were conducted, and patients were instructed to return for follow-up pulmonary function and arterial oxygen saturation assessments at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-surgery. In addition, patients were asked to complete online questionnaires at these time points. Oxygen saturation levels were also re-assessed before discharge, and patients were encouraged to complete a discharge questionnaire. Weekly phone calls were made to remind patients to continue their breathing exercises. The study analyzed 12 potential factors that might affect the outcomes, including preoperative nebulization use, surgical method, and patient age. The primary outcome measures were the effects of postoperative breathing exercises on FEV1, FVC, DLCO, and SPO2 at 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), and 6 months (T3) post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included LCQ cough assessment, FACT-L quality of life assessment, evaluations of pain and appetite, SAS anxiety level, SDS depression level, AIS sleep quality, and the modified MRAC assessment of dyspnea symptoms.

Results

The study initially enrolled 296 patients (T0), including 233 patients who underwent sublobar resection (SRP) and 63 patients who underwent lobectomy (LBP). Between T0 and T1, 203 patients remained in the SRP group and 47 in the LBP group. Between T0 and T2, 36 patients remained in the SRP group and 9 in the LBP group. By T3, the SRP group had 14 patients, and the LBP group had 5 patients remaining. Due to incomplete data, SPO2 measurements were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, the SRP group at T3 and the LBP group at T2 and T3 were not included in the analysis. In the SRP group, at T1, the BE group showed significantly better recovery in FEV1 and FVC compared to the control group. By T2, the BE group had a significantly improved sleep quality compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In the LBP group, at T1, the BE group demonstrated a significant advantage in alleviating anxiety symptoms compared to the control group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other outcomes.

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^16b38171]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical resection is the standard therapy for early-stage lung cancer patients and an important treatment method for patients with stage IIIA disease, ensuring a 5-year overall survival of about 60–80%. However, surgical resection has a detrimental impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), with a high prevalence of pain, fatigue, and dyspnea after surgery and most patients reporting a deterioration of their physical and role functions during the first postoperative month. –

In addition, although global quality of life (QoL) gradually returns to preoperative values by 3–6 months after surgery, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience functional limitations and symptoms of fatigue, pain, and dyspnea for 1–2 years after surgery.– These short- and long-term deleterious effects of surgery highlight the need for supportive interventions aimed at improving or restoring postoperative HRQoL, which is essential for promoting patient-centered care.

Exercise training is a promising non-pharmacologic intervention that has consistently shown positive effects on the HRQoL of cancer patients. It is the most effective treatment for cancer-related fatigue, and improves both physical and mental health. –

The current clinical guidelines for optimal perioperative care of lung cancer patients strongly recommend preoperative exercise training to improve postoperative outcomes. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that this intervention enhances exercise capacity and reduces the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. – Despite these benefits and the recommendations for routine evaluation of HRQoL in lung cancer care, the effects of preoperative exercise training on postoperative HRQoL remain unknown.,

Furthermore, research on preoperative exercise training for lung cancer patients has been focused on facility-based exercise programs,– although it is known that patients awaiting major cancer surgery prefer to exercise in their home setting, and that environmental barriers such as availability and transportation problems may hinder patients` access to prehabilitation.

Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative home-based exercise training (PHET) can prevent decline in HRQoL after lung cancer surgery. The secondary purpose was to evaluate the effect of PHET on the postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS) and physical performance of patients undergoing lung cancer resection.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^da199b18]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation evidence — pulmonary rehabilitation is typically hospital-based outpatient care with established benefits including reduced dyspnea, increased exercise capacity, improved quality of life, and reduced healthcare use. In a randomized trial of home-based versus center-based cycle ergometer training, all patients completed a 4-week educational program before randomization, dyspnea and exercise tolerance improved to an equivalent degree in both groups, and no significant safety issues were noted. Community-based pulmonary rehabilitation improved dyspnea, exercise endurance, strength, and nutritional indices in a 2-year randomized trial versus no rehabilitation, with higher intervention costs at 4 months offset by reduced hospital admission costs at 24 months. After severe exacerbations, a systematic review identified clear benefits in symptoms, health-related quality of life, and exercise tolerance, with possible benefits in hospital readmission and survival.

### Feasibility of postoperative home-based pulmonary function training for lung cancer patients: a real-world study [^65044c04]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Study design

This real-world study enrolled eligible patients(Fig. 1) into a research cohort. Upon admission, generally 3 to 7 days before surgery, nursing staff provided standardized guidance and training, distributing instructional manuals and exercise cards. The specific training included teaching patients how to perform pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing exercises, respiratory exercise routines, and training with a respiratory trainer (each for 20 min). Patients were instructed to complete the three aforementioned exercises on three self-selected days per week after discharge, and the attending physician reiterated the importance of home-based training before discharge. Patients and their families were informed to return for follow-up visits at the end of the 1st month (T1), 3rd month (T2), and 6th month (T3) post-surgery. Nursing staff followed up with patients weekly via phone calls and social media to remind and encourage them to complete their breathing exercises.

Fig. 1
Patients included in the study and follow-up information

Through the online medical system and questionnaires completed by patients, we collected detailed information, including pulmonary function test results, quality of life assessments, and adherence to breathing exercises. During each follow-up, patients underwent pulmonary function testing to measure FEV1, FVC, DLCO, and arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2). We used the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung instead of the more well-known SF-36 in order to more accurately assess the quality of life in patients with lung cancer. Additionally, patients completed standardized questionnaires to assess quality of life, anxiety, depression, pain, and appetite, allowing us to evaluate the impact of breathing exercises on their postoperative quality of life.

To ensure the scientific rigor and accuracy of the study results, we paid special attention to controlling confounding factors. Through the online medical system, we collected and included in the statistical analysis a range of confounding factors related to the patients' recovery, such as:

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^e4387aa7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative exercise training is recommended for improvement of clinical outcomes after lung cancer (LC) surgery. However, its effectiveness in preventing postoperative decline in quality of life (QoL) remains unknown. This study investigated the effect of preoperative home-based exercise training (PHET) on QoL after LC surgery.

Methods

Patients awaiting LC resection were randomized to PHET or a control group (CG). The PHET program combined aerobic and resistance exercise, with weekly telephone supervision. Primary outcome was QoL-assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) at baseline, before surgery, and 1 month after surgery. The secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and physical performance. The main analysis included a factorial repeated-measures analysis of variance. Additionally, the proportion of patients experiencing clinical deterioration from baseline to post-surgery was assessed.

Results

The study included 41 patients (68.1 ± 9.3 years; 68.3% male) in the intention-to-treat analysis (20 PHET patients, 21 CG patients). A significant group × time interaction was observed for global QoL (p = 0.004). Between-group differences in global QoL were statistically and clinically significant before surgery (mean difference [MD], 13.5 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–24.6; p = 0.019) and after surgery (MD, 12.4 points; 95% CI, 1.3–23.4; p = 0.029), favoring PHET. Clinical deterioration of global QoL was reported by 71.4% of the CG patients compared with 30% of the PHET patients (p = 0.003). Between-group differences in favor of PHET were found in pain and appetite loss as well as in physical, emotional and role functions after surgery (p < 0.05). Compared with CG, PHET was superior in improving preoperative five-times sit-to-stand and postoperative exercise capacity (p < 0.05). No between-group differences in other secondary outcomes were observed.

Conclusion

The study showed that PHET can effectively prevent the decline in QoL after LC surgery.

### Multidisciplinary home-based rehabilitation in inoperable lung cancer: a randomised controlled trial [^736ade07]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and high symptom burden. This trial aimed to assess the efficacy of home-based rehabilitation versus usual care in inoperable lung cancer.

Methods

A parallel-group, assessor-blinded, allocation-concealed, randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants were allocated (1:1) to usual care (UC) plus 8 weeks of aerobic and resistance exercise with behaviour change strategies and symptom support (intervention group (IG)) or UC alone. Assessments occurred at baseline, 9 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome, change in between-group 6 min walk distance (6MWD), was analysed using intention-to-treat (ITT). Subsequent analyses involved modified ITT (mITT) and included participants with at least one follow-up outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included HRQoL and symptoms.

Results

Ninety-two participants were recruited. Characteristics of participants (UC = 47, IG = 45): mean (SD) age 64 (12) years; men 55%; disease stage n (%) III = 35 (38) and IV = 48 (52); radical treatment 46%. There were no significant between-group differences for the 6MWD (n = 92) at 9 weeks (p = 0.308) or 6 months (p = 0.979). The mITT analyses of 6MWD between-group differences were again non-significant (mean difference (95% CI): 9 weeks: -25.4 m (-64.0 to 13.3), p = 0.198 and 6 months: 41.3 m (-26.7 to 109.4), p = 0.232). Significant 6-month differences, favouring the IG, were found for HRQoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung: 13.0 (3.9 to 22.1), p = 0.005) and symptom severity (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Lung Cancer: -2.2 (-3.6 to -0.9), p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Home-based rehabilitation did not improve functional exercise capacity but there were improvements in patient-reported exploratory secondary outcomes measures observed at 6 months.

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^3a27e79c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

PHET Group

The PHET program was previously tested in a feasibility trial, and is described following the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (Table S2). The length of the intervention was adjusted based on the waiting times for surgery and comprised three main components:
Educational session: During this session, a physical therapist instructed the patients about the importance of exercise training before lung cancer surgery, a factor that may increase exercise behavior, and demonstrated the correct technique of the home-based exercises. Additionally, patients were instructed on how to monitor training intensity using the Borg Category Ratio (Borg CR-10).
Home-based aerobic plus resistance training (concurrent training): The rationale for prescribing concurrent training was based on guidelines for exercise prescription in oncology and on recent clinical trials that identified the combination of low-to-moderate-intensity aerobic plus resistance training as effective in improving HRQoL for cancer patients. The aerobic training consisted of walking thrice weekly, 30 min per session. Walking was chosen because it is the exercise modality preferred by most lung cancer patients. Its duration was increased to 40 min after the second week of the intervention. Resistance training was prescribed twice weekly on non-consecutive days and consisted of six exercises (Fig. S1), performed for two sets of 15 repetitions. The number of sets was increased to three sets per exercise after the second week of the intervention. The main goal of resistance training was to improve lower body functional strength because it has been associated with better HRQoL in cancer patients. Training intensity was prescribed based on the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using the Borg CR-10 scale, a viable method for prescribing and monitoring training intensity in cancer patients. An RPE of 3–5 (moderate to strong) was recommended.
Telephone-based supervision: The PHET program was supervised through telephone calls by a physical therapist once a week.

Control Group

The CG received the usual preoperative care offered at the health care units involved, which did not include structured exercise training. Additionally, the CG received weekly phone calls, which consisted of standardized questions regarding fatigue, pain, and dyspnea symptoms. Postoperatively, the participants in both the PHET and CG groups received standardized inpatient rehabilitation focused on early mobilization, breathing exercises, and incentive spirometry.

Study Outcomes

The primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at three time points: T0 (baseline), T1 (before surgery, i.e. 1–5 days before surgery), and T2 (1 month after surgery).

Median adherence to the prescribed exercise program was overall 88% (IQR = 75%-100%; 1427 of 1680 planned exercise dosage), 88% (IQR = 79%-100%; 727 of 840 planned exercise dosage) for the aerobic training component and 88% (IQR = 75%-100%; 700 of 840 planned exercise dosage) for resistance exercise. Personal training program showed a median adherence of 85% (IQR = 77%-97%; 892 of 1056 planned exercise dosage), while the home-based program of 90% (IQR = 71%-100%; 535 of 624 planned exercise dosage). One patient in the home-based program required a dose modification for the resistance component, whereas another in the personal training program had to terminate the session early due to tachycardia onset. Overall, patients reported to have performed the sessions at the prescribed intensity (ie, 3–5 RPE). Nine nonserious adverse events were registered during the exercise sessions (Table 3), 5 in the personal training group and 4 in the home-based group; just in one case, the onset of an adverse event required interrupting the session as reported.

### Wearable device-based intervention for promoting patient physical activity after lung cancer surgery: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^56f7faec]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 5-year estimated survival rate for stage I NSCLC after curative resection is greater than 70%. However, most patients experience a substantial reduction in pulmonary function, especially in the immediate postoperative period. This decreased lung function is correlated with decreased physical activity, cardiopulmonary function, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) including patient-reported physical function and postoperative symptoms. Cardiopulmonary function generally improves over time as lung function increases, but 24% of patients do not return to their prior cardiopulmonary capacity at 6 months after surgical resection. In particular, the duration and intensity of physical activity at 2 weeks after surgery, as well as baseline physical activity, is predictive of recovery of long-term cardiopulmonary function. Thus, interventions to enhance perioperative physical activity (eg, aerobic exercise) are necessary after lung cancer surgery.

In a 2022 systematic review that included 10 randomized clinical trials, preoperative exercise programs resulted in a significant reduction (by as much as 55%) in the risk of developing pulmonary complications and an average decrease of 2 days in hospital stay. Preoperative exercise training led to increased postoperative physical performance, as measured by maximal oxygen consumption; however, its effects on physical performance, as measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), were uncertain. Postoperative exercise is also known to promote the recovery of cardiopulmonary function and to improve the physical component of HRQOL and symptoms. Despite the effectiveness of perioperative exercise training in patients with lung cancer, most studies were conducted under strict supervision and focused on the effects of breathing exercises and on-site exercise programs. This supervised training often limits patient access to facilities due to inflexible usage schedules and long distances from home. Thus, clinical evidence has not been translated into daily life, and most patients often do not meet the recommended physical activity levels. Accordingly, interest is growing regarding the use of nonsupervised and home-based training to promote and maintain physical activity.

### Exercise training undertaken by people within 12 months of lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer [^36ba3096]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Decreased exercise capacity and impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are common in people following lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exercise training has been demonstrated to confer gains in exercise capacity and HRQoL for people with a range of chronic conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, as well as in people with cancers such as prostate and breast cancer. A programme of exercise training for people following lung resection for NSCLC may confer important gains in these outcomes. To date, evidence of its efficacy in this population is unclear.

Objectives

The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of exercise training on exercise capacity in people following lung resection(with or without chemotherapy) for NSCLC. The secondary aims were to determine the effects on other outcomes such as HRQoL, lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)), peripheral muscle force, dyspnoea and fatigue as well as feelings of anxiety and depression.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2 of 12), MEDLINE(via PubMed) (1966 to February 2013), EMBASE (via Ovid) (1974 to February 2013), SciELO (The Scientific Electronic Library Online) (1978 to February 2013) as well as PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) (1980 to February 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which study participants withNSCLC, who had recently undergone lung resection, were allocated to receive either exercise training or no exercise training.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the studies and identified those for inclusion. Meta-analyses were performed using post-intervention datafor those studies in which no differences were reported between the exercise and control group either: (i) prior to lung resection, or(ii) following lung resection but prior to the commencement of the intervention period. Although two studies reported measures of quadriceps force on completion of the intervention period, meta-analysis was not performed on this outcome as one of the two studies demonstrated significant differences between the exercise and control group at baseline (following lung resection).

Main Results

We identified three RCTs involving 178 participants. Three out of the seven domains included in the Cochrane Collaboration' s 'seven evidence-based domains' table were identical in their assessment across the three studies (random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel). The domain which had the greatest variation was 'blinding of outcome assessment' where one study was rated at low risk of bias, one at unclear risk of bias and the remaining one at high risk of bias. On completion of the intervention period, exercise capacity as measured by the six-minute walk distance was statistically greater in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean difference (MD) 50.4 m; 95% confidence interval (CI) 15.4 to 85.2 m). No between-group differences were observed in HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.17; 95% CI -0.16 to 0.49) or FEV1 (MD-0.13 L; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.11 L). Differences in quadriceps force were not demonstrated on completion of the intervention period.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence summarised in our review suggests that exercise training may potentially increase the exercise capacity of people following lung resection for NSCLC. The findings of our systematic review should be interpreted with caution due to disparities between the studies, methodological limitations, some significant risks of bias and small sample sizes. This systematic review emphasises the need for larger RCTs.

### Effects of a long-term home-based exercise training programme using minimal equipment vs. usual care in COPD patients: a study protocol for two multicentre randomised controlled trials (HOMEX-1 and HOMEX-2 trials) [^504f057d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise training is an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programmes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the great majority of COPD patients who would benefit from PR never follow such programmes or fail to maintain exercise training after PR completion. Against this background, we developed an exercise training programme that requires minimal equipment and can be implemented long-term in the patient's home-setting. The aims of the HOMEX-1 and HOMEX-2 trials are to assess the effectiveness of this home-based exercise training programme in two groups of COPD patients over the course of one year: patients who have completed PR (HOMEX-1 trial) and patients who did not enrol in existing PR programmes within the last two years (HOMEX-2 trial).

Methods

HOMEX-1 and HOMEX-2 are multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trials. For both trials each, it is planned to include 120 study participants with a diagnosis of COPD. Participants will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio into the intervention group or the control group (usual care/no intervention). The intervention consists of minimal-equipment exercise training elements with progressive level of intensity, conducted by the participant during six days per week and instructed and coached by a trained health care professional during three home visits and regular telephone calls during one year. Primary outcome is change in dyspnoea (domain of Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire) from baseline to 12-months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are change in dyspnoea over the course of the year (assessed at 3, 6 and 12month) and change in functional exercise capacity, physical activity, health-related quality of life, health status, exacerbations and symptoms from baseline to 12months follow-up. In addition, explanatory, safety and cost-effectiveness outcomes will be assessed. We will conduct intention-to-treat analyses separately per trial and per protocol analyses as sensitivity analyses.

Discussion

The HOMEX-1 and HOMEX-2 trials assess a novel intervention that provides an innovative way of making exercise training as accessible as possible for COPD patients. If the intervention proves to be effective long-term, it will fill the gap of providing an easily accessible and feasible intervention so that more COPD patients can follow an exercise programme.

### Feasibility and outcomes of a real-world regional lung cancer prehabilitation programme in the UK [^9ec1c209]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- Postoperative complications and length of hospital stay are reduced by prehabilitation.
- Prehab4Cancer is an innovative regional programme serving the Greater Manchester area in the UK, in which patients planning surgical resection receive assessment and interventions before surgery.
- This paper describes the programme's feasibility, uptake, and outcomes in 377 patients referred before the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The programme was feasible at scale with high uptake and had a positive impact on preoperative physiological and subjective functional assessments, providing a framework for wider implementation.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the UK with approximately 35 000 deaths every year. Surgical resection at an early stage offers the best chance of long-term survival, and the number of lung cancer operations in the UK is increasing year on year (∼7000 per year currently). Further improvements in early detection, such as through targeted screening, are leading to a greater proportion of patients with lung cancer being diagnosed at a stage where surgical resection is possible. Therefore, there is renewed focus on optimising outcomes in lung cancer surgery.

Prehabilitation describes patient optimisation before treatment, such as lung cancer surgery. Exercise training is a core intervention, but prehabilitation also involves allied components, such as nutritional and psychological well-being assessment and support. It is increasingly recognised as an important phase of cancer treatment pathways, reducing complication rates, improving functional capacity, and improving quality of life. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs of exercise training before lung cancer surgery demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of postoperative complications (risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25–0.69), postoperative length of stay in hospital (mean difference –2.29 days; 95% CI: –0.98 to –3.59), and improved exercise capacity (6 min walk distance mean difference +37.6 m; 95% CI: +20.5 to +54.7). Given this strong evidence supporting the efficacy of prehabilitation before lung cancer surgery alongside the increasing volume of lung cancer surgery, service delivery is the primary challenge.

### Safety and feasibility of exercise interventions in patients with advanced cancer: a systematic review [^309664f0]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

The beneficial effects of exercise in cancer patients are reasonably well-established, although research in this field has predominantly investigated cancer patients in the earlier stages of disease. However, the most recent evidence surrounding exercise interventions in advanced cancer populations has yet to be systematically evaluated. This review critically analyses the safety and feasibility of exercise interventions in patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

All randomised, non-randomised and prospective observational trials of exercise training interventions in patients with advanced cancer were included. 'Safety' was defined as the number and severity of reported adverse events during exercise training. 'Feasibility' was determined by participant adherence, attendance and/or study completion rates.

Results

A total of 25 studies involving 1088 patients were included: 16 randomised controlled and nine prospective observational cohort trials. Seven studies included advanced lung cancer patients exclusively, while eight involved patients with various cancer diagnoses. Aerobic exercise was investigated in five studies, resistance training in two studies and combination training (aerobic and resistance) in 14 studies. Six minor adverse events were reported due to exercise. All of these were musculoskeletal in nature, resulting in two participants' withdrawal from the study. Exercise adherence ranged from 65 to 89% but was only described in nine studies. Attendance at each exercise session was described in a further nine studies, ranging from 59 to 100%.

Conclusions

Implementation of exercise interventions appears to be safe and feasible in advanced cancer clinical practice, although targeted studies are required to determine the optimal exercise dose for specific cancer diagnoses.

### Feasibility and outcomes of a real-world regional lung cancer prehabilitation programme in the UK [^03f980da]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer P4C pathway

In the pilot programme, patients with lung cancer were eligible for P4C if surgical resection was planned, as it is this cohort of patients who have the clearest evidence of benefit. The inclusion criteria were lung cancer MDT-agreed diagnosis of primary lung cancer with a treatment recommendation of surgical resection, aged 18 yr or over, registered with a GM primary care service, able to access the programme either independently or with support from a carer/family member, indicated informed consent to be referred, and walked more than 250 m on the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). As a community programme without clinical facility support, embedded risk assessment at all stages of the pathway was crucial to mitigate the risk of adverse events during prehabilitation. The ISWT is widely used across GM in the lung cancer pathway because of its reproducibility, accessibility, and a strong evidence base. An ISWT > 40 shuttles (400 m) correlates to a VO 2max > 15 mL kg −1 min −1 on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), a value deemed to represent good physiological function in national guidelines on the risk assessment for lung cancer surgery. However, the shuttle walk may underestimate VO 2max at the lower ranges with more than half of patients with a shuttle walk < 250 m having a VO 2max > 15 mL kg −1 min −1. More recent data demonstrated that a shuttle walk of > 25 shuttles (250 m) has a 90% positive predictive value for VO 2max > 15 mL kg −1 min −1. Consequently, the P4C Lung subgroup recommended that patients with an ISWT > 400 m would be suitable for a universal (unsupervised) prehabilitation programme, those with an ISWT of 250–400 m would be suitable for a targeted (supervised) prehabilitation programme, but those with an ISWT < 250 m would require further assessment with CPET. After CPET, patients with a VO2 max > 15 mL kg −1 min −1 were deemed eligible for a universal (unsupervised) prehabilitation programme, those with a VO 2max 10–15 mL kg −1 min −1 would be suitable for a targeted (supervised) prehabilitation programme, but those with a VO 2max < 10 mL kg −1 min −1 generally signified prohibitive risk for lung cancer surgery and were also unlikely to be able to safely complete a community-based exercise programme. These patients were therefore deemed ineligible for the programme. A future requirement for cancer prehabilitation will be the development of specialist pathways for patients with greater levels of frailty and comorbidity to ensure equity of access to the benefits of prehabilitation safely, but this was not available in this transformation and implementation phase.

### Feasibility of postoperative home-based pulmonary function training for lung cancer patients: a real-world study [^b0bb3300]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the increasing awareness of health and the advancement of thoracoscopic techniques, an increasing number of small pulmonary nodules are being detected early and surgically removed, leading to a younger demographic of patients undergoing surgical treatment. Many of these patients are asymptomatic prior to surgery. Compared to elderly patients, younger patients — especially asymptomatic ones — tend to be more concerned about the impact of surgery on their postoperative quality of life. Pulmonary surgery significantly affects respiratory function. According to the British thoracic society (BTS), patients should have an FEV1 of more than 1.5 L before lobectomy and more than 2 L before pneumonectomy. At the same time, PFT is also an indicator of the degree of dyspnea. It is more intuitive to evaluate the impact of surgery on patients by PFT. According to reports, both FEV1 and FVC sharply decline by the second week post-surgery, followed by gradual recovery. At six months postoperatively, patients who underwent sublobar resection (SRP) regained approximately 93% of their preoperative FEV1 and FVC, whereas those who underwent lobectomy (LBP) regained 87% and 86%, respectively. In addition, postoperative symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and anxiety or depression are common burdens for lung cancer patients. Therefore, improving patients' quality of life after surgery has become a pressing issue. Pulmonary rehabilitation is commonly used to improve the quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), effectively enhancing respiratory muscle function and alleviating dyspnea symptoms. Studies have shown that preoperative respiratory muscle training, such as respiratory muscle endurance training, can significantly improve the endurance of respiratory muscles in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) postoperatively and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Н.А. Шефер et al. reported that 2 weeks of preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation training can significantly improve the cardiopulmonary function of patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and thus prepare the patients for further surgical treatment. Additionally, there is evidence that preoperative home-based exercise training can significantly improve patients' postoperative quality of life. However, despite the potential benefits of postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation training for improving the quality of life in lung cancer patients, adherence remains poor, particularly after discharge, with most patients struggling to follow the prescribed training regimen. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the effects of postoperative respiratory training on postoperative lung function recovery and quality of life in patients using real-world data and to provide evidence for optimizing postoperative rehabilitation strategies.

### Prehabilitation for lung cancer patients undergoing… [^3a0774c8]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Lung surgical resection is the gold standard treatment for earlier stages of lung cancer patients. Nevertheless, postoperative pulmonary complications are frequent, related to morbidity and mortality, increasing length of hospital stay, hospital costs, delaying adjuvant treatments, and patients suffering. The PPC often occurs on postoperative days, even after hospital discharge. Prehabilitation might reduce PPC, although few studies have compared the effectiveness of different training protocols, and no information is available regarding the possible benefits of expiratory muscle training. Moreover, there are no comparisons of the cost-benefits of other protocols in patients submitted to lung resection surgery. This project investigates the effectiveness of and compares four different prehabilitation protocols in reducing PPC and LOS in patients selected for lung cancer resections.

Afterward, all patients will receive an education class and written information regarding healthy habits to follow before, during, and after hospital discharge. Patients allocated to exercise groups will start the prehabilitation intervention for two weeks. After the intervention, patient assessments will be repeated. After that, patients will be submitted to surgery, and anesthetic and surgical procedure data will be collected. During hospital recovery, all patients will receive physiotherapy and any etiological complications and the LOS will be recorded according to medical criteria. After hospital discharge, PPC will be monitored and recorded for 30 days; by then, patients will be submitted to the final assessment. To achieve the project's aim, sample size was calculated using G*Power 3.

After surgery, all patients will receive standard care at the Cardiothoracic Department, including daily medical assessment, physiotherapy care, and analgesic protocol. Postoperative pulmonary complications or from any other etiology, as well as the length of hospital stay, will be recorded. Any postoperative complication and hospital readmission in the next 30 days will be monitored and recorded. The criteria of PPC will be established according to the European Society of Thoracic Surgery and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons joint agreement and standardized definition.

Preoperative exercise interventions in operable NSCLC — Overall, the three studies published to date suggest that short-term (about 4 weeks) multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation or supervised aerobic training is a safe and well-tolerated intervention associated with significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and functional capacity (6-min walk distance) prior to surgical resection. No randomized trials of pre surgical rehabilitation in lung cancer have been reported, and because published studies have important methodologic limitations, adequately powered, prospective trials with appropriate control groups are warranted.

Results

Feasibility, uptake, and participation

During the 11 month period evaluated, 377 patients were referred to the Lung P4C service, originating from 11 hospitals across the GM region (range: from nine to 70 referrals per centre). Amongst the 377 patients referred to P4C, 52.3% (n = 197) were female, and the median age was 72 yr (inter-quartile range [IQR]: 66–77). Twenty-nine patients could not be contacted by telephone, primarily because the referrals did not include a valid telephone number. From the contacted patients (n = 348), 80.5% (n = 280) attended the first assessment. On ITT analysis, 74.3% (n = 280/377) of patients referred completed an assessment. The median interval between referral and initial assessment was 8 days (IQR: 4–14) with 48.2% (n = 135/280) of assessments within 7 days.

During the initial telephone contact and first assessment, 8.6% (n = 30/348) were deemed medically unsuitable to participate in P4C. Overall, 64.3% (n = 180/280) of patients who attended a first assessment went on to complete the prehabilitation phase with a median number of sessions completed of 6 (IQR: 4–9). The median interval from assessment to surgery was 36 days (IQR: 22–55). Overall participation on an ITT basis was 47.7% (n = 180/377). Fig. 1 provides the reasons for non-participation at each stage of the pathway. Overall, 21.2% (n = 80/377) of referred patients declined or withdrew. From the 377 referrals, 30 patients (8%) were deemed unsafe to participate or proceed with the programme because of concerns about their physiological reserve and safety to undertake the prescribed prehabilitation programme. During this service delivery period, there were no adverse events during participation in exercise sessions reported by the exercise specialists to the P4C steering group.

### Exercise medicine in the management of pancreatic cancer: a systematic review [^f9b5decb]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

Feasibility Profile

An overview of the feasibility profiles of the exercise interventions is presented in Table 2. All included trials explicitly reported no intervention-related adverse events (AEs). or did not provide relevant description in the article. However, there was a range of non–intervention-related AEs in some of the included trials mainly due to the aggressive nature of PanCa and treatment-related side effects. For example, multiple events of death (n = 18) and disease progression (n = 3) were reported in the trials by Yeo et aland Wiskemann et al. In addition, AEs/symptoms including incisional hernia (n = 1), fracture (n = 1), deep vein thrombosis (n = 1), constipation (n = 1), nausea and vomiting (n = 1), and mucositis (n = 1) were reported in 3 trials. All of the AEs resulted in temporary or permanent discontinuance of the exercise programs, or a reduction in the prescribed exercise intensity.

Apart from the incidence of AEs, other feasibility metrics were provided in the included trials. Yeo et aland Wiskemann et alreported a recruitment rate of 93% and 21%, respectively. In addition, Marker et alalso reported that only 3 participants were enrolled during an 8-month recruitment period, and as a result, the study was reported as a case series. The included RCTs, and single-arm trialreported dropouts, and the retention rates for the exercise groups were 76%,75% and 71% (for supervised and home-based exercise groups, respectively), and 75%(reported as 90% in the later published articlefrom the trial). However, reasons for dropouts were only provided in the RCTs, including death, disease progression, treatment-related side effects, further resection required, and withdrawal. Participants' attendance to the planned exercise sessions was reported in 3 trials, and the attendance rates were 73%,64% and 78% (for supervised and home-based sessions, respectively), and 96%. In addition, Marker et alreported that for 85% of the prescribed weeks, participants attended at least 2 sessions per week. Only McLaughlin et alreported the participant's actual completed exercise intensity, that is, 100% and 69% for supervised sessions in nonchemotherapy and chemotherapy weeks, respectively, and 83% for exercise during infusion.

### Feasibility of postoperative home-based pulmonary function training for lung cancer patients: a real-world study [^ec8083a3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Postoperative lung resection significantly impacts patients' lung function and quality of life. A study by Luciana Nunes Titton Lima et al. found that patients' quality of life within the first six months after surgery was generally lower than that of the general population, as assessed by QOL questionnaires, reflecting the negative impact of surgery on patients' daily subjective experiences. Research suggests that systematic pulmonary rehabilitation plays a positive role in postoperative recovery. For example, a study by Soo Koun Kim et al. found that more than three months of systematic pulmonary rehabilitation (including respiratory muscle and skeletal muscle training) improved patients' quality of life more effectively than home-based exercise, and six months of rehabilitation significantly promoted the recovery of vital capacity (FVC). Additionally, Maja S. Sommer et al. highlighted that rehabilitation programs including health education and psychological counseling benefited the quality of life and mental health of stage IIIa lung cancer patients post-surgery. While systematic rehabilitation is beneficial for postoperative recovery, its availability in hospitals or rehabilitation centers is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the recovery effect of home-based rehabilitation training on patients. In the present study, no significant difference in PFT was observed between the training groups of SRP and PLP at 1 month after surgery, and the case-control study by Soo Koun Kim et al. showed similar experimental results at 1 month after surgery; however, they observed significant differences at 6 months after surgery. As Win et al. pointed out that pneumonectomy caused a sudden drop in FEV1 and FVC within the first month after surgery, which did not slowly recover until three months after surgery, 49 we believe that pain may be one of the reasons for the nonsignificant difference in PFT in the short term after surgery. At one month post-surgery, the LBP training group experienced significantly reduced anxiety compared to the control group, while no significant difference was observed in the SRP group. Analysis of the collected questionnaires suggests that this difference may be due to higher baseline anxiety levels in the LBP group prior to surgery. Interestingly, Fengju Wang et al. pointed out that cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) was beneficial in alleviating anxiety and depression in NSCLC patients at three and six months post-surgery, incorporating deep breathing exercises and psychological interventions. Although the CBSM group showed better recovery at one month compared to the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. This suggests that postoperative anxiety relief may rely more on repeated deep breathing exercises. Although the SRP training group showed better sleep quality at three months post-surgery compared to the control group, we remain cautious about this result. Upon reviewing the study process, we identified two potential causes: (1) small sample bias due to the limited sample size after propensity score matching (PSM), and (2) some patients in the SRP group included in the analysis had undergone subsequent treatment. According to a study by Mei-Ling Chen et al. patients undergoing chemotherapy experienced poorer sleep quality during the fourth cycle, which could be a key factor contributing to bias in our results. One of the major challenges in postoperative recovery is improving patient adherence. In the early stages of the study, relying solely on nursing staff for health education was insufficient, with a follow-up loss rate as high as 70% at one month post-surgery. However, as the follow-up supervision process improved — including standardized training for health educators, involvement of attending physicians, and weekly reminders via social media and phone calls by study coordinators — Although the return visit rate and training participation rate of patients have been improved, the loss to follow-up rate is still close to half. Compared with training in rehabilitation centers, patients receiving home training mode need more supervision to achieve better results. This study has certain limitations. (1) Because the subjects were mainly from the same medical institution, the sample may be limited in terms of region and population representativeness, and the results lack general applicability. (2) The high rate of loss to follow-up in this study caused a certain selection bias and also led to incomplete follow-up results. If the problem of poor compliance of patients can be solved in the future, a more comprehensive understanding of home-based rehabilitation can be obtained. Therefore, hospital guidance combined with remote supervision by telephone and social software can promote patients to exercise at home and improve the quality of life of patients to a certain extent. This provides a new perspective for postoperative rehabilitation, that is, the digital rehabilitation platform combining the Internet and medical institutions is expected to become the "family rehabilitation therapist" for lung cancer patients.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in lung cancer, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), and lung transplantation is supported by mixed evidence with defined practice considerations and tools. In lung cancer, preoperative PR has "small, uncontrolled observational studies," and postoperative PR includes "Small uncontrolled trials; two RCTs comparing aerobic training, resistive training or both in postsurgical lung cancer patients is ongoing; one systematic review," with outcomes of "Improved exercise tolerance… possible change in status from noncandidate for surgical resection to operative candidate," "Increased walking endurance, increased peak exercise capacity, reduced dyspnea and fatigue," and "Variable impact on quality of life." For scheduling, "Short duration e.g., 2–4 wk, up to 5 times per week, needed to avoid delay in potential curative surgery." In LVRS, evidence includes a "Prospective observational study…;… a small case series (effect of home-based PR before LVRS)," with "Pre-LVRS PR and exercise training: Improved exercise capacity (peak workload, peak VO2, walking endurance), muscle strength, dyspnea, and quality of life." "Oxygen saturation should be monitored," with perioperative education elements specified, and "Quality of Well Being Score" is listed as an assessment tool. In lung transplantation, "Pretransplant PR: Improved exercise tolerance and well-being," and post-transplant PR shows "Increased muscle strength, walking endurance, maximal exercise capacity, and quality of life." "Exercise prescription must be tailored to patients with severe end-stage lung disease… Patients may require lower intensity or interval training. Hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation should be monitored closely; O2 should be available," and assessment tools note that "Usual outcome assessments for COPD, such as CRQ and SGRQ, are appropriate."

We will adjust the per-protocol analyses with prognostic factors for the primary outcome dyspnoea (dyspnoea, lung function [FEV 1], exercise capacity and events of exacerbations) and for adherence to conduct the exercises (self-efficacy to conduct the exercises, exercise capacity, dyspnoea and acute worsening of health state [exacerbations and other]) and with the information whether the patients conducted other exercise strength trainings. Concerning the control group, we will collect as much information as possible, especially with respect to the type and frequency of self-organised exercise training. This will also be included in the per-protocol analysis.

The cost-effectiveness of the intervention and comparator will be assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The analysis will be performed using a time horizon of one year (i.e. equal to the maximal follow-up of the trial) and using a societal perspective. No interim analyses are planned.

Home-based and community-based exercise training — In COPD, an equivalence study comparing appropriately resourced home- versus outpatient exercise training after a 4-week educational program found important outcomes equivalent for both groups, with a lower than anticipated 6MWT response but equivalent and meaningful improvements in cycle endurance time. A randomized prospective home-based program including individuals with severe COPD who used long-term supplemental oxygen enrolled 50 individuals and confirmed efficacy and safety. A 12-week home exercise program delivered via a user-friendly computer system for five or more days per week in 25 clinically stable patients produced significant improvements in exercise performance, arm-lift and sit-to-stand repetitions, and health status scores. Regarding outpatient delivery, there is no strong evidence to suggest any difference in outcome between hospital-based and non–hospital-based programs for individuals with moderate to severe COPD.

### Cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer: a research agenda: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^479eb5bb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Lung cancer survivors — baseline activity and exercise training evidence — on average walk approximately 3,000–6,000 steps/d and 350–450 m on the 6-minute-walk test, with declines in physical activity and functional capacity within six months after diagnosis. After pulmonary resection, a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 61 patients tested a 20-week high-intensity aerobic and resistance training program starting 5–7 weeks postoperatively versus usual care and improved maximum exercise capacity and physical and mental HRQoL, but cancer-related fatigue (CRF) was not assessed. A 2019 Cochrane review concluded that exercise training within 12 months of resection improves functional and maximal exercise capacity; however, only three RCTs involving 68 patients assessed CRF and showed no statistically significant difference in the effect of exercise training on CRF, with similar CRF-null findings reported for inoperable lung cancer. Preoperative exercise training, in up to 10 RCTs involving 566 participants, reduces postoperative pulmonary complications and length of hospital stay, but no study assessed CRF as an outcome. Lung cancer survivors are older, with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years versus 62 yr (breast), 66 yr (prostate), and 67 yr (colorectal).

### Feasibility of home-based exercise training during adjuvant treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (EXACT) [^dd0a1a9a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

In terms of feasibility, our recruitment rate from the eligible population was 61%. When we acknowledge that many men were excluded due to ineligibility/unsuitability and recognise the landscape of recruitment during several waves of COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions, as well as competing trials (i.e. INTERVAL-GAP4), this recruitment rate is encouraging. Moreover, it indicates demand and willingness in men with advanced prostate cancer to engage in a lifestyle-related intervention while receiving ongoing treatment. Compared to other exercise trials in PC, our recruitment rate was lower than some interventions, equal to others, including supervised, but crucially greater than other interventions incorporating remote options. It is important to consider the volume of patients screened or referred when determining recruitment rates, with greater numbers seemingly resulting in lower recruitment rates and highlighting a need for a streamlined referral pathway. Of those screened (n = 117), 49 patients (42%) were approached by their clinician with the opportunity to participate, suggesting strong clinical support for this intervention. Sixty-one percent (n = 30) of those approached provided informed consent and were enrolled, with 93% (n = 28) attending for baseline assessment. The retention rate for this intervention was strong, standing at 86% post-intervention and 79% at follow-up (from baseline). Compared to other home-based trials, our retention rate is greater and similar to those reported during supervised interventions, further reiterating a determination to engage while facing persistent toxicities. While our retention is on par, supervised interventions have greater adherence (89–93%), although this current trial has greater compliance than others offering solely home-based or home-based as an intervention arm. Compared to other home-based interventions, we also have the greatest task completion of physical and patient-reported outcomes at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up. Pragmatically, we scheduled outcome measures to coincide with routine clinical visits and conducted assessments within our co-located exercise facility, providing continuity in treatment and minimising the burden placed on patients, likely leading to the high attendance and completion rates observed. In agreement with similar trials in PC, no intervention-related adverse events were reported. Collectively, our findings alongside other trials suggest that exercise training is safe and feasible and could be delivered as an adjuvant therapy to support patients with mCRPC. Within the UK National Health Service implementation of supervised exercise could prove problematic (e.g. economic and staffing), hence the rationale for this cost-effective, home-based, remotely managed alternative to maintain safety, retention and compliance. This strategy does not place any further economic strain on the health service, is flexible and inclusive, and is perhaps more palatable to patients who are already burdened by ongoing treatment.

### Physical activity and lung cancer screening (PALS): feasibility randomised controlled trial of exercise and physical activity in lung cancer screening [^04c9fd7e]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This was a feasibility study aimed at evaluating recruitment, adherence, and intervention safety, and therefore enrolment contact was attempted consecutively and/or at existing follow-up appointments. As such, the majority of our study cohort met PA guidelines at baseline. In these instances, participants were offered to increase the duration and/or intensity of PA, focus on endurance and strengthening, or maintain current PA goals. In future studies aimed at evaluating efficacy, incorporation of baseline PA levels to determine eligibility would be desired to ensure the intervention is improving baseline low levels of PA. This study did not collect information regarding smoking cessation attempts; however, this would be useful in future research given previously demonstrated benefits of PA on smoking patterns. Due to the nature of the intervention, study participants and staff were not blinded to the intervention. A high proportion of participants also experienced respiratory illness during the exercise program impacting progress. This is likely related to the winter season.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a home-based exercise program is feasible and safe and could be a low-risk, intervention with significant benefits for high-risk individuals participating in a lung cancer screening program. Like with smoking cessation advice, the opportunity to intervene with PA advice at the point of lung cancer risk assessment of people with an active smoking history, even in those who may not be eligible for screening, may be invaluable. Further evaluation of the home-based exercise program is needed to determine efficacy as part of a lung cancer screening program.

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^82705464]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Outcome: HRQoL

The study assessed HRQoL using the Portuguese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) version 3.0, as recommended by the international consensus on patient-centered outcomes for lung cancer. The Portuguese version of the questionnaire was previously validated with 933 cancer patients, revealing good psychometric properties.

The QLQ-C30 includes a global QoL scale, five functioning scales, three multi-item symptom scales, six single-item symptom scales, and a financial impact scale. Scores range from 0 to 100 points, with a high score on the global QoL and functioning scales indicating a high QoL/high level of functioning and a high score on the symptom scales indicating a high level of symptomatology.

In this study, the global QoL scale was chosen as the main outcome of HRQoL, as previously recommended. Additionally, following the recommendations of the EORTC Quality-of-Life Group, the QLQ-C30 summary score (SumSc) was used to supplement the 15-outcome profile generated by the QLQ-C30.

### Preconditioning program reduces the incidence of prolonged hospital stay after lung cancer surgery: results from the move for surgery randomized clinical trial [^25792615]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer resection is associated with high rates of prolonged hospital stay. It is presumed that preconditioning with aerobic exercise can shorten the postoperative duration of hospital stay, but this has not yet been demonstrated in trials after lung cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to perform a RCT to determine whether Move For Surgery (MFS), a home-based and wearable technology-enhanced preconditioning program before lung cancer surgery, is associated with a lower incidence of prolonged hospital stay when compared to usual preoperative care.

Methods

Patients undergoing lung resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled before surgery into this blinded, single-site RCT, and randomized to either the MFS or control group in a 1: 1 ratio. Patients in the MFS group were given a wearable activity tracker, and education about deep breathing exercises, nutrition, sleep hygiene, and smoking cessation. Participants were motivated/encouraged to reach incrementally increasing fitness goals remotely. Patients in the control group received usual preoperative care. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients with hospital stay lasting more than 5 days between the MFS and control groups.

Results

Of 117 patients screened, 102 (87.2 per cent) were eligible, enrolled, and randomized (51 per trial arm). The majority (95 of 102, 93.1 per cent) completed the trial. Mean(s.d.) age was 67.2(8.8) years and there were 55 women (58 per cent). Type of surgery and rates of thoracotomy were not different between arms. The proportion of patients with duration of hospital stay over 5 days was 3 of 45 (7 per cent) in the MFS arm compared to 12 of 50 (24 per cent) in the control arm (P = 0.021).

Conclusion

MFS, a home-based and wearable technology-enhanced preconditioning program before lung cancer surgery, decreased the proportion of patients with a prolonged hospital stay. Registration number: NCT03689634 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and pulmonary rehabilitation — NETT findings and program effects: In the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, 1,218 individuals underwent outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation before and after randomization, and those with upper lobe–predominant emphysema and baseline low exercise capacity after preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation had gained a survival benefit at 24 months after LVRS, with the surgery group also showing greater gains in exercise capacity, timed walking distance, quality of life, pulmonary function, and dyspnea. Pulmonary rehabilitation administered before LVRS is safe and effective, and in NETT it led to significant improvements in peak exercise workload (cycle ergometry), walking endurance (6-min walk test), dyspnea, and quality of life, with additional improvements in peak aerobic capacity and muscle strength reported; no increased incidence of adverse events has been reported in pulmonary rehabilitation of individuals with severe COPD preparing for LVRS. After LVRS, pulmonary rehabilitation is helpful in reversing deconditioning, improving mobility and monitoring oxygenation and the need for medications, and may potentially reduce some of the postoperative complications, although it is unclear whether preoperative improvement in exercise tolerance leads to greater benefits from LVRS, lower postoperative complication rate, or postoperative mortality benefit.

### A modified exercise protocol may promote continuance of exercise after the intervention in lung cancer patients – a pragmatic uncontrolled trial [^14918a69]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

A previous study investigated the effects of a well-documented COPD exercise protocol in lung cancer patients. The study showed improvements in physical fitness, but poor adherence to continued exercise after intervention. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a modified exercise intervention on post-intervention adherence, and physical fitness in a broad group of lung cancer patients.

Methods

Fifty-nine patients enrolled in a 9-week exercise program. Eligibility criteria were limited to presence of motivation, and absence of comorbidities that could jeopardize safety. The intervention included three times 3 weeks of exercise (3 weeks supervised, 3 weeks home-based and 3 weeks supervised). The patient's activities were structured by logbooks during the 3 weeks at home. VO2 max was estimated at baseline and at the end of intervention. Self-reported quality of life was recorded before and after the exercise program. Post-intervention exercise activity was assessed by telephone interviews 4 weeks after intervention.

Results

Fifty-one patients initiated the exercise intervention and 29 patients successfully completed the exercise program. Full data were available for 25 patients regarding estimated VO2 max. Twenty-six of the 29 were available for follow-up with respect to continuance of physical activity. Among the 26 who completed the 9-week training program, 18 (69%) continued to be physically active on a daily basis. No change in estimated VO2 max was observed. A trend towards increased quality of life and better symptom control was noted.

Conclusions

The present study showed an increased level of continuance of physical activity compared to the previous study. The present study could, however, not repeat the significant improvements in estimated VO2 max from the previous study.

### Exercise, diet, and weight management during cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^39880130]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — exercise during active cancer treatment recommends routine exercise for curative-intent therapy and allows preoperative exercise in lung cancer. Oncology providers should recommend aerobic and resistance exercise during active treatment with curative intent to mitigate side effects of cancer treatment (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate to low; Strength of recommendation: strong). Exercise interventions during active treatment reduce fatigue; preserve cardiorespiratory fitness, physical functioning, and strength; and in some populations, improve QoL and reduce anxiety and depression, and they have low risk of adverse events; however, evidence was not sufficient to recommend for or against exercise during treatment to improve cancer control outcomes (recurrence or survival) or treatment completion rates. Oncology providers may recommend preoperative exercise for patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer to reduce length of hospital stay and postoperative complications (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Fit 4 surgery, a bespoke app with biofeedback delivers rehabilitation at home before and after elective lung resection [^74f80765]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 15% of patients develop post- operative complications after lung surgery which can result in death, admission into an intensive care unit, prolonged hospital stay and readmission to hospital after discharge. The evidence on pre- and post-operative rehabilitation in lung resection surgery is poor, mainly due to the heterogeneity of patient population, interventions and outcomes. Recently published Enhanced Recovery After Surgery guidelines recommend the use of prehabilitation for patients with borderline lung function or exercise capacity. Meta-analysis of studies of pulmonary rehabilitation and/or exercise classes for lung surgery patients demonstrate improvement in exercise capacity, quality of life and a reduction in post-operative complications. However, access to rehabilitation services can be hampered because of limitations in local health care resources and patient reluctance to attend multiple classes. Rehabilitation services can find it difficult to deal with the fluctuation in demand from flow of lung cancer surgery patients so can struggle to provide a consistent service.

Therefore, there is a need for a service that can be delivered immediately at the convenience and in the control of the patient. Mobile device use in the healthcare sector to access systems has rapidly evolved with an explosion in software applications (apps). Apps have been shown to support education for self-management and provide extensive feedback to users to facilitate behaviour change. Physical activity interventions incorporating technology have been used with varying degrees of success in the medical disease setting but not in the surgical arena. Knowing that pulmonary rehabilitation consisting of exercise classes is beneficial to lung surgery patients but is resource limited and that apps can promote physical exercise in other disease settings, we sought to develop a bespoke pulmonary rehabilitation app and test its feasibility and acceptability to patients undergoing lung resection surgery.

### Does a pulmonary rehabilitation based ERAS program (PREP) affect pulmonary complication incidence, pulmonary function and quality of life after lung cancer surgery? Study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^ea232cf7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive pulmonary resection is currently the most frequent and effective intervention for lung cancer. However, lung cancer surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) with a reported incidence of 15.8–31.7% based on large sample studies. This is higher than the incidence for other major surgical procedures such as orthopedic surgery (0.3–3.6%), cardiac surgery (1.5–28.4%), upper and lower abdominal surgery (1.8–23.7% and 1.9–4.3%). The term PPC is defined as clinically significant respiratory complication or dysfunction requiring medical and rehabilitation intervention. Although the causes of PPCs are multifactorial, surgical procedure induced systemic inflammatory and catabolic response have been proposed as major contributing factors in the development of PPCs, leading to the changes in the short-term activity ability, and long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mortality after lung cancer surgery.

### A pilot phase II RCT of a home-based exercise intervention for survivors of AML [^dea5d326]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue is the most common and disabling symptom affecting quality of life (QOL) and daily function in patients who have completed treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although trials in patients with various solid tumors have reported improved fatigue and QOL following exercise interventions, there have been no studies in AML patients post treatment.

Methods

Forty patients aged ≥ 40 years who had completed treatment for AML were enrolled in a 12-week randomized phase II exercise intervention to determine feasibility (recruitment, retention, and adherence), efficacy, and safety of the intervention. Patients assigned to the exercise group received an individualized, moderate-intensity, 12-week home-based exercise program with weekly telephone support from a certified exercise physiologist. QOL, fatigue, and fitness outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Between-group differences in 12-week change scores were calculated using linear regression adjusting for age and baseline function.

Results

Recruitment and retention rates were 38% and 91%, respectively. Adherence was low at 28%. Analyses did not suggest statistically significant or clinically important benefits in QOL, fatigue, or physical fitness with the intervention. The level of adherence did not appear to impact outcomes. There were no adverse events.

Conclusion

A home-based exercise program for post-treatment AML patients age 40 years or older can be safely delivered with reasonable recruitment and high retention. However, feasibility was hampered by low adherence. Further research and program modification are needed to better understand and overcome barriers to exercise delivery and adherence in AML survivors.

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^28dc87a7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The novel findings of this study were that PHET is clinically effective in improving the HRQoL of lung cancer patients awaiting surgical resection and preventing its deterioration after surgery. Specifically, the PHET group showed improvements in preoperative global QoL, physical function, and fatigue compared with the CG. More importantly, these beneficial effects were maintained postoperatively, with the patients who participated in PHET reporting a significantly and clinically better global QoL than the patients in the CG. Furthermore, 1 month after surgery, the PHET group exhibited significantly better physical, emotional, and role functions, together with fewer symptoms of pain and appetite loss than the CG.

These findings are clinically relevant given that the preoperative HRQoL of lung cancer patients is significantly worse than in the general population, and surgical treatment causes even further impairments in short- and long-term HRQoL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicenter RCT demonstrating that a short-term preoperative home-based exercise intervention (3–4 weeks) can improve HRQoL after lung cancer surgery.

The beneficial effects observed on global QoL, physical function, and fatigue are aligned with the strong evidence that exercise training is effective in improving these domains of HRQoL among cancer patients. However, much of this evidence is provided by clinical trials conducted with breast cancer survivorsand with patients undergoing (neo-)adjuvant treatment or after oncologic treatment, limiting the generalization of the findings.

In the context of lung resection, only a few trials have examined the effects of prehabilitation on postoperative HRQoL. Ferreira et al.found that patients who performed prehabilitation consisting of a multimodal intervention (home-based aerobic and resistance exercise plus nutritional counseling and anxiety-reduction strategies) had significantly better global QoL, physical function, and mental function 4 weeks after surgery than patients who started the intervention postoperatively.

These results are partially aligned with a clinical trial involving patients who underwent resection for benign and malignant lung disease. The findings showed that preoperative exercise training improved physical function 3 months after surgery compared with usual care, although no significant differences in mental function were observed. Collectively, these findings corroborate our results by indicating that the benefits of preoperative exercise training in terms of global QoL and physical function persist after lung cancer surgery. However, further research is warranted to examine the effects of this intervention on mental and emotional function after surgery.

### Pre-treatment optimization with pulmonary rehabilitation in lung cancer: making the inoperable patients operable [^e392b026]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Our prospective study is in keeping with previous studies that demonstrate the beneficial impact of preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation or physiotherapy programs to improve exercise capacity in patients undergoing thoracotomy and lung resection. Exercise and physical activity at an appropriate level have been shown to reduce symptoms of dyspnoea, improve PS, improve quality of life, and potentially reduce length of hospital stay and complications following surgery for lung cancer. Thus, with a standardized Prehab program one can expect improvement in dyspnoea scores and PS as demonstrated in our study. In reality patients being considered for treatment for lung cancer often experience difficulties in being active. Indeed, 80.1% of our patients were found to have a sedentary life style at assessment. Performance status, a measure of how well lung cancer patients are able to carry on ordinary daily activities, provides an estimate of what treatments a person may tolerate. 54.2% of our patients had high PS scores placing them at a high risk for post-operative morbidity and mortality. In keeping with the feasibility study by Jones et al. and our pilot program, our study demonstrates that a structured Prehab program can improve activity levels and PS of patients prior to major thoracic surgery allowing patients to then safely undergo curative lung resection.

In the present study, 12.9% of patients had PS of 3 or 4 and dyspnoea scores of > 3 and were considered inoperable due to a prohibitively high risk of post-operative pulmonary complications, breathlessness and death. This was indicated by high thoracoscores for this group. With a standardized Prehab program 84.2% of the high-risk patients were optimized and ready to proceed with radical treatment, namely radiotherapy or surgery. Indeed 42.8% of patients proceeded to surgery with outcomes similar to patients considered to have low risks for adverse events or death, as indicated by low thoracoscores for the group. Our study supports our hypothesis that by improving preoperative dyspnoea, PS, activity levels, and frailty, Prehab allows patients who were initially considered inoperable on subjective criteria of dyspnoea and PS, to become suitable for surgery. Prehab thus allows high-risk patients to safely receive curative surgery with a reduced risk of postoperative complications and mortality as demonstrated.

### Construction of a postoperative home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program protocol for lung cancer patients delivered using the internet: a Delphi-based study [^83ecf3c9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the most common cancer (accounting for 11.4% of all new cancer cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (accounting for 18.0% of all cancer deaths) worldwide. The disease burden of lung cancer is even more prominent in China, where lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, with an increasing trend. Zheng et al.showed that the number of new lung cancer cases and deaths in China increased by about 162.6% and 123.6% from 2000 to 2016.

The primary and optimal treatment option for lung cancer is surgery, especially among early-stage patients. Although surgery can improve the survival rates of lung cancer, patients frequently suffer from postoperative cardiopulmonary complications, such as tracheal stenosis, lung infection, lung atelectasis, and lung function decline. In addition, lung cancer survivors may suffer chronic symptoms such as fatigue and pain, and psychological distress such as depression and anxiety. These challenges not only negatively impact the patient's quality of life but also lead to prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. It is thus urgent and essential to develop effective prevention and intervention programs to address the postoperative challenges faced by lung cancer patients.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a multidisciplinary intervention designed to comprehensively improve a patient's lung function and overall well-being through a series of standard procedures, including education, exercise training, and psychosocial support. Initially developed for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), PR has now been widely used among patients with lung cancer with well-demonstrated effects in reducing postoperative complications and improving quality of life. The core component of PR is exercise training, particularly aerobic and resistance exercises, which can reverse skeletal muscle dysfunction by strengthening muscles and improving cardiovascular function. These exercises can improve exercise tolerance and physical fitness while reducing the feeling of breathlessness (dyspnea) and fatigue associated with respiratory conditions, leading to enhanced overall quality of life. Abundant evidence has shown that hospital-based PR is a safe and feasible intervention to improve the health outcomes of patients with lung cancer.

### Sex differences in response to a 12-week resistance training exercise intervention after cardiac surgery: a proof-of-concept intervention trial [^5297724a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, which often follows major acute cardiac events, is traditionally focused on aerobic exercise and has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality. Its benefit among cardiac surgery patients is less clear, as is the role of resistance-based exercise programs and their sex-specific effects. This study seeks to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a 12-week resistance training program in patients post cardiac surgery through a sex-specific lens.

Methods

We conducted a nonrandomized feasibility trial with a 12-week strength training exercise intervention. The primary outcome was safety and feasibility. Secondary outcomes included changes in strength, endurance, and functional capacity; and sex differences among these. Adult participants post open-heart surgery who had completed traditional cardiac rehabilitation were consented. Both patients who completed (cases) or did not complete (controls) a tailored 12-week resistance training program underwent comprehensive assessment of physiologic and physical fitness measures pre- and postintervention.

Findings

Nine participants enrolled in the trial, including 6 in the intervention arm (median age 61 years; 67% male) and 3 in the control arm (median age 66 years; 67% male). No serious adverse events were noted, indicating safety of the intervention. Participants completed a mean of 34.8/36 (96.7%) of sessions, indicating the feasibility of the program. Although not powered for statistical significance, patients experienced positive trends of improvement in measures of hand grip strength, endurance, and functional capacity with the intervention. When stratified, females experienced greater gains than males in these measures.

Implications

This proof-of-concept study found that resistance-based exercise after cardiac surgery is well tolerated and feasible. Although all patients experienced improvements in exercise parameters, females reported greater relative improvement than males.

### Fit 4 surgery, a bespoke app with biofeedback delivers rehabilitation at home before and after elective lung resection [^cc397d64]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary rehabilitation programme for lung surgery patients can reduce the risk of post-operative complications but compliance to programmes can be limited by access to health care. We developed a home-based rehabilitation app and tested its feasibility in patients undergoing lung resection surgery.

Methods

A cohort study was conducted over 18 months at a regional thoracic unit. The Fit 4 Surgery app included ten exercises. Patients were instructed to exercise for at least three minutes for each exercise. Data was transmitted back to the researchers remotely. Data was also collected from a contemporaneous group of surgery patients who attended local outpatient-based Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease rehabilitation classes. Quality of Life and outcomes data in the app group were collected. Patients were also interviewed about their experience of the app.

Results

App patients had a shorter wait before surgery compared to patients attending rehabilitation classes (24 vs 45 days) but managed four times as many sessions (2 vs 9), improving incremental shuttle walk test distance by 99 ± 83 (p < 0.05) metres before surgery. Five themes were gathered from the interviews.

Conclusion

An app based programme of rehabilitation can be delivered in a timely fashion to lung surgery patients with demonstrable physiological benefits; this will need to be confirmed in further clinical trials.

### Novel multimodal intervention for surgical prehabilitation on functional recovery and muscle characteristics in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (MMP-LUNG) [^2a2f9576]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

The MM group receives the active supplement and a resistance and aerobic exercise programme. During the 4 to 6 weeks prior to surgery, participants have 1 weekly in-person kinesiologist-supervised session and biweekly at home sessions. The training consists of (1) 30 min per day of cumulated aerobic exercise of their preferred type (walking, machine or other), at a moderate intensity of 12–15 on a Borg scale of 6 to 20, including a 5 min warm up and cool down and (2) 30 min, 3 times per week, of resistance exercise targeting major muscle groups with the use of a Theraband or body weight. These are instructed to be performed in 2 sets of 8–12 repetitions for each exercise, with the intensity becoming 'difficult' to perform (rate of perceived exertion of 5–6/10) by the end of the set. The programme is individualised based on initial assessments and in line with American College of Sport Medicine standards. Technique, intensity and progression are monitored weekly; intensity or duration is increased weekly, if tolerated. Patients are given an information booklet containing instructions and figures showing all elements of the programme and a Borg scale to assist in determining appropriate exercise intensity at home. Non-exercising NUT and CTL participants are contacted weekly by phone to provide equivalent monitoring time and encouragement.

After discharge, MM participants follow a customised weekly home-based programme similar to the preoperative training with an on-site supervised session at week 3. During the postoperative exercise session, participants perform preoperative exercises free of resistance in the active range of motion, and based on pain tolerance, resistance is progressively increased. Home sessions are monitored with weekly telephone or video calls for follow-up and adjustments by the study kinesiologist.

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^d0f44c56]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another important finding of the current study was that the patients in the PHET group had significantly better role function and fewer symptoms of pain and appetite loss after surgery than those in the CG. These results are impactful given that most lung cancer patients had a clinical deterioration in role function and experienced significantly more pain and appetite loss 1 month after surgery compared with preoperative levels. – Previous studies on this topic suggest that exercise training is effective in improving the role function of cancer patients. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the effect of this intervention on pain and appetite loss. Because no RCTs have been conducted with patients awaiting lung cancer surgery, it is not possible to compare the current results with those of other studies. This highlights the need for future studies to investigate the effect of preoperative exercise training on these HRQoL domains.

The secondary purpose of this study was to determine the effects of PHET on physical performance and LOS. We found that PHET resulted in significantly better performance in the preoperative 5STS test than CG. This represents an important finding because poor performance in the STS test before lung cancer surgery has been linked to a greater risk of postoperative complications. Additionally, in line with a previous trial, we found that PHET prevented the decline in postoperative exercise capacity, which is clinically important because patients' exercise capacity declines significantly after surgery. Because exercise capacity is independently associated with HRQoL after curative treatment for lung cancer, the beneficial effects of PHET on this outcome may have contributed to patients experiencing a better HRQoL, possibly by improving their ability to perform activities of daily living.

Although previous meta-analyses showed that preoperative exercise training reduces the LOS after lung cancer surgery, no significant differences between groups were observed in the current study. However, it should be noted that most studies included in these meta-analyses were single-center trials conducted in a facility-based setting, emphasizing the need for future multicenter RCTs to verify the effects of home-based exercise training on this outcome.

### Wearable device-based intervention for promoting patient physical activity after lung cancer surgery: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^4c20f7bb]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Study Groups

Intervention Group

The intervention was designed to include 3 phases: preoperative intervention (from diagnosis to surgery), immediate postoperative intervention (from discharge to 2 months after surgery), and postoperative intervention (from 2 to 6 months after surgery). In the intervention group, the initial exercise program consisted of 30 minutes of general education about exercise.

A cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed before training to determine the optimal individual training dose and to rule out cardiopulmonary limitations or contraindications. The cardiopulmonary exercise test was a mandatory element of our web-based approach to prescribe adequate exercise and protect participants from overload. If the participant had reached the target set for the previous week (> 70% completion rate), the target was reset. The exercise program was personalized based on the fitness test performed at baseline according to American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. The routine included a 5-minute warm-up, 30 to 90 minutes of endurance training (starting at 45%-70% of heart rate reserve), respiratory muscle training with an inspirometer (10 repetitions, 3 times per day), and a 5-minute cool-down, performed 5 days per week. In addition, patients were given a guidebook on how to perform the muscle strength exercises. All exercises were clearly explained and demonstrated at the beginning of the 3 phases (preoperative intervention, immediate postoperative, and postoperative intervention), and patients were asked to perform the program at home and unsupervised. Throughout the intervention period, a wearable device (Fitbit Versa, version 1 [Fitbit Inc] [hereinafter, device A]) was used to monitor step count, activity intensity, activity time, frequency, and heart rate during exercise to provide real-time feedback. Using the monitored patient activity data, an exercise physiologist with 20 years of experience (S.K.) conducted transtheoretical model–based patient counseling through weekly or biweekly telephone calls, using web-based data from the intervention device. Physical activity levels were promoted by setting goals for gradual increases in number of daily steps and time spent on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). However, participants were not provided with incentives to improve compliance or adherence.

Control Group

The control group received only usual care, which comprised inspiratory exercises using an incentive spirometer and walking exercises. No specific individual guidance on exercise was provided to the control group, particularly regarding preoperative and postoperative activities.

### Pre-treatment optimization with pulmonary rehabilitation in lung cancer: making the inoperable patients operable [^5c364d2e]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, in patients with low DLCO whilst the overall length of stay was no different to the low-risk patients, they required a longer duration of care in the HDU. In healthy subjects DLCO has the capacity to improve with exercise in response to the increase in pulmonary blood flow. Its impairment during the preoperative workout has been correlated with the occurrence of postoperative complications after lung resection. Despite Prehab and immediate post-operative rehabilitation, patients with a low baseline DLCO required a longer period of care in the HDU. This is consistent with the study by Novoa et al. who demonstrated that in patients with impaired DLCO, following lung resection the physiological increase in DLCO during exercise is still impaired on the third postoperative day.

Patient's ≥ 75 years-of-age have a significantly higher frequency of post-operative pulmonary complications. Cancer Research informs us that the demographics of patients with lung cancer is getting older. In this ageing population frailty is increasingly being recognized as an independent risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes, namely, major morbidity, mortality and protracted LOHS. Our study is unique in that we have used the Canadian 9-point Clinical Frailty Scale as an index to assess patients for levels of frailty and demonstrated that almost half the patients referred for Prehab had an index of greater than 3. Thus suggesting that a significant proportion of elderly patients are vulnerable to post-operative adverse events. By providing a standardized Prehab program to elderly patients with frailty and improving their frailty index, our study is the first of its kind to address frailty in surgical patients.

Our prospective study showed that a standardized Prehab program makes inoperable patient with potentially resectable disease operable, and safely undergo curative lung resection. This strategy we believe will help improve resection rates and may contribute to the long term survival of lung cancer patients. Lancet Oncology published the findings of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP), Cancer Survival in High-Income Countries (SURVMARK-2) project in November 2019. Notably, the survival of patient with lung cancer amongst other cancers was poor. A multi-pronged approach is no doubt required to improve the survival of patients with lung cancer. Optimizing patients who are considered inoperable due to significant dyspnoea, impaired PS, frailty, borderline or poor pulmonary functions and providing them access to safe, curative surgery is one approach.

### Effects of a long-term home-based exercise training programme using minimal equipment vs. usual care in COPD patients: a study protocol for two multicentre randomised controlled trials (HOMEX-1 and HOMEX-2 trials) [^ac9eaaeb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise training is an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and the management of COPD. Numerous trials have shown that exercise training with or without additional PR elements leads to clinically significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. However, despite the well-known benefits, the great majority of patients who would profit from PR never follow such a programme. On the other hand, for those patients who undergo a supervised exercise training programme, it is often challenging to maintain exercising after PR completion and to implement the training into the daily life home-setting. Major barriers for not participating or adhering to programmes are travel and transport to the centre, disruption to established routine, lack of perceived benefits, social isolation, inconvenient timing, comorbidities and depressive symptoms.

Traditionally, PR programmes were given under direct supervision at a rehabilitation centre with participants attending as inpatients or outpatients. However, both community-based and home-based programmes are becoming increasingly popular. Of the studies included in the most recent systematic review on the effects of PR vs. usual care in COPD patients, approximately one third comprised home-based programmes or programmes that included an element of home-based training embedded in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Of the studies that focused on home-based training alone, the programmes typically lasted eight to twelve weeks, the follow-up assessments were primarily conducted at the end of the programme without a more long-term perspective and their effect on HRQoL and exercise tolerance compared to usual care was not consistent across studies.

Evidence from two recent trials suggests that the effects of comprehensive home-based PR programmes were equivalent or non-inferior to the effects of outpatient PR, both after completion of the programmes (12 and 8 weeks, respectively) and after one year. These results were supported by a current systematic review that found similar beneficial effects of home-based compared to outpatient exercise training programmes. However, as demonstrated in other studies, in both, the home-based and outpatient PR groups the strong effects detected immediately after completion of PR either decreased or vanished in the long-term after 12 months. Another recent trial showed beneficial effects of a long-term maintenance exercise training programme (following PR) after two years; however, the programme included use of cycle ergometers which were delivered to the participants' home, and weight training. Moreover, patients visited the hospital for supervised exercise training sessions on a regular basis.

### Pilot project: heart chargers – A successful model for a home-based physical activity program utilizing telemedicine for fontan patients [^8a54d535]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fontan patients have decreased exercise capacity which further declines throughout adolescence. A positive exercise capacity trajectory in children predicts better adult Fontan outcomes. Hospital-based physical activity programs improve exercise capacity and attenuate the age-expected decline in Fontan patients. The purpose of this project was to investigate the feasibility and safety of a partially reimbursable 12-month, home-based, individualized physical activity program (Heart Chargers) for Fontan patients utilizing telemedicine. The Heart Chargers team included a cardiologist, nurse coordinator, and exercise physiologists. Eligible participants with a Fontan completed a baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and consented to participate in Heart Chargers, a 12-month home-based exercise prescription. The individualized exercise prescription focused on skeletal and respiratory muscle strength training and aerobic activities. Participants received a Garmin© device to monitor adherence. Telephone check-ins ranged from weekly to monthly as participants gained independence. Pre- and post-program CPET and informal surveys of physical activity self-efficacy were completed. Nine participants have completed the Heart Chargers program. There was no pre-post difference in maximal or submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2), peak heart rate, or oxygen saturation. There was a significant pre-post increase in systolic blood pressure (p-value 0.004) and minute ventilation (p-value 0.012) at peak exercise. Per subjective report, exercise-related self-efficacy increased after program completion. There were no adverse events. At present, 7 participants remain actively enrolled in the program. Heart Chargers, a novel, home-based, partially reimbursable, 12-month individualized exercise program using telemedicine was successfully implemented in Fontan patients with no adverse events. The lack of decline in exercise capacity for participants is encouraging.

### Multimodal prehabilitation before lung resection surgery: a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^5f608d7e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Study participants

Four hundred and seventy-four patients were screened with CPET, resulting in 132 patient being randomised (Fig. 1). Data from the nonrandomised patients have been reported elsewhere. In the prehabilitation group, eight patients were excluded after randomisation, compared with two patients from the usual care group who withdrew their consent to participate (Fig. 1).

Effect of prehabilitation programme

In the prehabilitation group, the hospital-based supervised training visits were completed by all patients, with 100% self-reported compliance for home self-training (Table 1). During prehabilitation, mean maximal respiratory pressure increased over the six supervised visits (Fig. 2). After 2 weeks of prehabilitation, VO 2, VCO 2, P ET 2, and DL CO increased, with a reduction in the V E /VCO 2 slope (Table 2; Supplementary Table S1). The prehabilitation intervention also reduced the number of active smokers (Table 2). Self-reported quality of life (EQ-5D-3L) improved with prehabilitation, whereas that of patients randomised to usual care decreased with surgery (Fig. 3). None of the patients required nutritional support.

### Effect of walking on circadian rhythms and sleep quality of patients with lung cancer: a randomised controlled trial [^c170f5c3]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Interventions

A 12-week regimen of home-based walking exercises, comprising walking at a moderate intensity for 40 min, three times a week, was administered along with weekly exercise counseling. After collecting pretrial measurements, we explained the participants how to perform the exercises, according to an instruction manual for the exercise regimen. The detailed instructions, provided at the hospital clinics, included the determination of activity intensity, demonstration of pulse measurement, criteria for scores of 6–20 on the Borg's rating of perceived exertion (RPE;), prevention of exercise-related injuries, and conditions necessitating termination of an exercise session. Participants were instructed that the exercises would be effective only if they reached 60–80% of the target heart rate, as determined by the Karvonen method, and 13–15 on the RPE.

For each participant, we discussed exercise regimen-related issues weekly through the telephone. For instance, we discussed whether participants' exercise fulfilled the prescribed intensity, duration, or frequency and whether the participants experienced any adverse effects. If a patient had not exercised for ⩾3 days and we determined that this lack of exercise was not due to adverse effects of exercising, we reiterated the exercise instructions and encouraged the patient to continue the regimen. The participants were reminded to record their activity after every session and were instructed that after completing the regimen in 3 months, we would collect the record of physical activities for calculating the regimen completion rates (Please see the ' Supplementary Material B: Instructions for the home-based walking exercise program' for details).

The usual-care group

The usual care group was provided services similar to those provided to the walking exercise group depending on their treatment (e.g. postoperative care, chemotherapy care, and outpatient department follow-up), except for the 12-week regimen of home-based walking exercise training and weekly telephone exercise counseling. The patients were asked to maintain normal daily activity and not perform additional exercise during the study period. For ethical considerations, we mailed the exercise booklet to the participants and offered exercise counseling at the end of the study.

### SupPoRtive exercise programmes for accelerating REcovery after major ABdominal cancer surgery trial (PREPARE-ABC): pilot phase of a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^478ee40f]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

PREPARE-ABC is a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial including an internal pilot designed to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of pre- and postoperative exercise in relation to short- and longer-term postoperative recovery outcomes in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgical resection. Here, we report on internal pilot phase data for the first 200 patients randomised to the trial, which included prespecified stop-go criteria used to inform the decision to progress to the fully powered trial by the funder.

Methods

Eligible and consenting patients are randomly assigned (1:1:1) to hospital-supervised exercise, home-supported exercise or treatment as usual (TAU). Randomisation is concealed but clinical teams providing treatment and participants are unmasked. Primary outcomes are 30-day morbidity (Clavien-Dindo) and 12-month health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Health Questionnaire). Here, we present findings from the prespecified pilot phase which assessed feasibility of site set up, recruitment, adherence and acceptability of trial processes to patients and site staff.

Results

Between 9 November 2016 and 18 May 2018, 18 sites were set up, with 200 patients randomised to either hospital-supervised exercise (68), home-supported exercise (69) or treatment as usual (TAU) (63). Across the groups, 19 patients did not proceed to surgery or withdrew and 52% experienced a complication. Over half of the participants (57%) in the hospital-supervised group attended ≥ 6 preoperative sessions and 50% attended ≥ 5 monthly postoperative exercise "booster sessions". In the home-supported group, 70% patients engaged with ≥ 2 telephone support sessions in the preoperative phase and 80% engaged in ≥ 5 monthly telephone support "booster sessions". Adverse events were reported by 22 patients and three patients reported a serious adverse event. The majority of complications were Clavien-Dindo grades 1–2; however, 16 patients experienced one or more Clavien-Dindo grade 3–4 complication(s).

Conclusions

Results of the internal pilot phase confirm the feasibility of site set-up and patient recruitment, representativeness of the sample population and adequate adherence to hospital-supervised and home-supported exercise. On the basis of these positive results, progression to the fully-powered trial was authorised by the funder.

### A structured exercise program for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^4eeb7642]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Exercise improves functional outcome and symptoms for certain cancer populations, but the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of structured exercise in patients with lung cancer is unknown. In this study, we examined the feasibility of a hospital-based exercise program for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Methods

This study included patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–1. A physical therapist facilitated twice-weekly sessions of aerobic exercise and weight training over an 8-week period. The primary end point was feasibility of the intervention, defined as adherence to the exercise program. Secondary endpoints included functional capacity, measured by the 6-minute walk test and muscle strength, as well as quality of life, lung cancer symptoms and fatigue, measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-lung and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue scales.

Results

Between October 2004 and August 2007, 25 patients enrolled in the study. All participants received anticancer therapy during the study period. Twenty patients (80%) underwent the baseline physical therapy evaluation. Eleven patients (44%) completed all 16 sessions. An additional 6 patients attended at least 6 sessions (range, 6–15), and 2 patients only attended one session. Study completers experienced a significant reduction in lung cancer symptoms and no deterioration in their 6-minute walk test or muscle strength.

Conclusions

Although the majority of participants attempted the exercise program, less than half were able to complete the intervention. Those who completed the program experienced an improvement in their lung cancer symptoms. Community-based or briefer exercise interventions may be more feasible in this population.

### Construction of a postoperative home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program protocol for lung cancer patients delivered using the internet: a Delphi-based study [^56820370]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the wide application of PR is limited due to the high cost of involving health professionals and low patient compliance related to transportation difficulties and time constraints. Furthermore, despite the well-demonstrated benefits of exercise and physical activity in improving lung function, lung cancer diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce muscle strength, exercise capacity, and physical function. The combination of the disease and treatment can cause skeletal muscle wasting, leading to reduced strength and the inability to perform physical activity. Disease-related symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and breathing difficulties, can lead to further functional limitations, making it challenging to participate in social activities and resulting in a decreased quality of life. These limitations necessitate a multidisciplinary approach to providing comprehensive support and an individualized approach to tailoring the support to meet the individual's specific needs and abilities.

Recent studies have shown that home-based PR via the Internet was comparable to hospital-based PR in decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications and improving quality of life while overcoming the barriers to attendance and adherence. "Internet + " home-based PR relies on the Internet platform to provide standard education, training, and support for patients, with continuous follow-up management, which is not subject to time, space, social, or economic constraints. In addition, it addresses the shortage of health professionals and medical resources related to PR, thereby ensuring the sustainability of PR and patient compliance. Multiple evidence-based guidelines have been developed all over the world focusing on supervised, center-based PR or telerehabilitation PR supervised at home. These guidelines provide updated definitions of PR, identify essential components of PR, establish requirements for successful and effective PR delivery, highlight significant advances in PR implementation, and develop evaluation approaches to inform the formulation of clinical recommendations.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive and systematic guidelines on "Internet + " home-based PR for patients with lung cancer after surgeries in China. Therefore, we conducted the current study to construct a postoperative home-based PR protocol via the "Internet + " (PHPRPI) for lung cancer patients through the literature review and the Delphi method. Our findings would provide a reference and guidance for the broad application of cost-effective PR among lung cancer patients to prevent postoperative complications and improve their quality of life.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^ce45c879]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — program duration and session structure — longer programs are thought to produce greater gains and maintenance of benefits, with a minimum of 8 weeks recommended to achieve a substantial effect, and programs longer than 12 weeks have been shown to produce greater sustainable benefits than shorter programs; improvement in functional exercise capacity seems to plateau within 12 weeks, whereas changes in daily physical activity levels were seen only after 6 months and had not occurred after 3 months despite marked improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life. Outpatient programs commonly meet 2 or 3 days/week, inpatient programs are usually planned for 5 days/week, and session length per day is generally 1–4 hours.

### A feasibility study investigating an exercise program in metastatic cancer based on the patient-preferred delivery mode [^f8c55565]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Feasibility of exercise in patients with metastatic cancer is still a challenge. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an exercise intervention based on a patient-preferred delivery mode in patients affected by metastatic cancer.

Materials and Methods

Forty-four patients with a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic cancer were recruited in a 3-month exercise program. Whereas the exercise program consisted of aerobic and resistance activities performed twice a week, the participants may choose the mode of delivery: home based, personal training, or group based. The primary endpoint was the feasibility, defined by recruitment rate, attendance, adherence, dropout rate, tolerability (comparing the session RPE with the target RPE), and safety (using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0). Secondary endpoints included cardiorespiratory fitness (six minutes walking test), muscle strength (handgrip strength test and isometric leg press test), flexibility (the back scratch and chair sit and reach tests), anthropometric parameters (body mass index and waist-hip ratio), quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire), and amount of physical exercise (Godin's Shepard Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire). Descriptive statistics, Student t test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze data.

Results

The study recruitment rate was 81%. Out of 44 recruited patients, 28 chose the personal training program, 16 chose the home-based program, and none chose the group-based program. Nine dropouts occurred (20%), 6 in the personal training program, and 3 in the home-based intervention. The median attendance rate was 92%, adherence was 88%, tolerability was 100%, and 9 nonsevere adverse events were registered during the exercise sessions. An increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (P < .001) and flexibility (P = 0.011 for chair sit and reach; P = 0.040 for back scratch) was observed at the end of the intervention, while no changes in anthropometric values and muscle strength were detected. Different quality-of-life domains were improved following the intervention, including physical (P = 0.002), emotional (P < .001), and role functioning (P = 0.018), fatigue (P = 0.030), and appetite loss (P = 0.005).

Conclusion

A 3-month exercise program based on a patient-preferred delivery mode is feasible in patients with metastatic cancer and may improve physical function and quality of life.

Trial Registration

NCT04226508.

### Feasibility and outcomes of a real-world regional lung cancer prehabilitation programme in the UK [^250556f6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prehabilitation, or multimodality patient optimisation before major treatment, has demonstrated meaningful improvements in patients' outcomes. In the setting of lung cancer surgery, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay are reduced, but there is currently limited access to prehabilitation. Prehab4Cancer (P4C) is an innovative regional programme serving all areas of Greater Manchester (GM).

Methods

The lung cancer P4C service commenced in 2019 as a collaboration between the GM Cancer alliance and 12 leisure and community organisations. Patients planning surgical resection could be referred to receive exercise, nutrition, and well-being assessment and interventions before surgery. We evaluated the programme's feasibility, uptake, and outcomes during the 11 months before COVID-19 restrictions.

Results

In total, 377 patients were referred to the lung cancer P4C service from all 11 hospitals in GM. Of the patients reached by telephone, 80.0% (n = 280/348) attended initial P4C assessment, which occurred a median of 8 days (inter-quartile range [IQR]: 4–14) after referral. In addition, 74.3% (n = 280/377) attended for baseline assessment and 47.7% (n = 180/377) completed prehabilitation, attending a median of six sessions (IQR: 4–9). Statistically significant improvements in all objective physiological and subjective functional assessments were observed preoperatively, including a mean increase in the incremental shuttle walk test of 50 m (95% confidence interval: 25–74; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The P4C programme demonstrated feasibility at scale, high uptake, and promising impact on the status of patients with lung cancer before surgery. P4C is the first regional prehabilitation service internationally, and this evaluation provides a framework for implementing similar services in other regions.

### A feasibility study investigating an exercise program in metastatic cancer based on the patient-preferred delivery mode [^17e36672]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study indicates that a physical exercise program, based on patients-preferred delivery mode, on the basis of predefined criteria is feasible in patients with metastatic cancer; indeed our intervention has reported an 81% recruitment rate, a median attendance of 92%, and adherence of 88%, an optimal tolerance, a good safety profile, and a 20% of dropout rate. A recent systematic review on patients with advanced cancer reported a median recruitment rate of 68% and attendance rate of 86%; focusing on patients with metastatic disease, recruitment, dropout, and attendance rates varied, ranging from 25% to 75%, 17.8% to 50%, and 50% to 89%, respectively, suggesting that feasibility is highly heterogeneous across the trials. Most of the studies included in such revision were conducted under a fully supervised context, and among the reasons for nonparticipation, the travel distance to the study site was found relevant. Home-based programs could break down this barrier, offering patients a more flexible intervention; on the other hand, patients have a greater degree of autonomy to manage training with potential implications in its attendance and completion. In this sense, a 12-week home-based program, including walking and resistance training with elastic bands, in men with metastatic prostate cancer showed a 47% of recruitment rate, 27% of patients who withdrew, and 80% of adherence to the walking program, and only 63% of resistance component. Similarly, another trial testing the feasibility of a walking program in patients with different metastatic cancer reported a 38% of recruitment rate and a 45% of attrition rate. Our study reported high rates of recruitment, adherence and attendance, and a low dropout; additionally, no important difference for such feasibility outcomes was observed between the personal training program and the home-based program and neither the aerobic and resistance components. This finding is particularly interesting and may suggest that the intervention design may have favored these aspects. Indeed, allowing patients to choose their preferred exercise modality may allow patients to have a proactive role in their care pathways without being conditioned by the impositions of others, leading to an increase in their empowerment. Another concern related to the proposal of a single exercise modality is that it may not suit all patients, especially in the metastatic cancer setting. The most deconditioned patients may feel particularly uncomfortable in a home-based program, mainly because of safety issues; vice versa, patients with a preserved psycho-physical condition may not need or prefer a close supervision. Our exploratory analysis confirmed this hypothesis: at baseline, patients who have chosen the home-based program had a better profile in the anthropometric values, in strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and some domains of quality of life, while patients in the personal training program were more deconditioned. In this light, from the healthcare and kinesiologists' perspectives, the proposal of multiple modalities of exercise delivery may have several advantages, including supervising the frailest patients and having a time-saving intervention (ie, a home-based program) that allows following several patients simultaneously. Another in point in favor of the present study is the lack of serious adverse events which highlights a good safety profile. Only 9 nonserious events were observed and just in one case it require a dose modification and an early session termination. Scott et alin their trial investigating aerobic exercise in patients with metastatic breast cancer reported an higher rate of adverse events during the training sessions, however, even in this case, the side effects were nonserious, confirming the acceptable safe profile of exercise.
