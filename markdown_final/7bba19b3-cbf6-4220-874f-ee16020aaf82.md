## Question

A 50-year-old is being evaluated for monthly intramuscular naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid use disorder. What major risk of this therapy should the psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner discuss with the patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what major risk should be discussed when initiating monthly intramuscular extended-release naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid use disorder in a 50-year-old patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of naltrexone and which risks are unique to antagonist therapy. Then, I should verify the FDA labeling to identify emphasized warnings and their rationale. Next, I'll cross-check professional society guidance, particularly ASAM, to confirm counseling priorities. Finally, I will differentiate initiation risks from ongoing and post-discontinuation risks and synthesize the key counseling message.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacologic risk per the FDA label. Naltrexone produces a potent but surmountable blockade of opioid receptors; patients can attempt to overcome the blockade with large opioid doses, which can precipitate overdose, and, more critically, when the blockade wanes or the medication is stopped, opioid tolerance is reduced so that previously tolerated doses can cause life-threatening respiratory depression and circulatory collapse, with fatal overdoses reported after discontinuation, so I need to ensure this risk is clearly explained to the patient and family [^116Tkmub].

> I need to check guideline concordance to be sure I am not over- or under-emphasizing this. ASAM explicitly instructs clinicians to inform patients discontinuing naltrexone about the increased risk of opioid overdose and overdose death with return to use, and to pair this counseling with overdose prevention, including naloxone for the patient and training of close contacts, which reinforces that post-discontinuation overdose risk is a priority counseling point, not a rare event to mention in passing [^112vRs18] [^116HPtYE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should differentiate this from other risks that might compete for "major risk" status. At first I almost prioritized precipitated withdrawal at initiation, but wait, let me verify the scope: precipitated withdrawal is indeed a significant initiation risk if the patient is not opioid-free for at least 7–10 days or is transitioning from methadone or buprenorphine, and requires clinical readiness checks and possibly a naloxone challenge, yet this is an initiation management issue rather than the principal long-term safety risk of therapy itself, whereas the post-discontinuation loss of tolerance with overdose risk is the more lethal and counterintuitive hazard that must be discussed upfront; injection-site reactions and rare hepatotoxicity are important, but they do not eclipse overdose risk in severity or priority, and the surmountable blockade during treatment also carries overdose danger if patients try to override it, which I should caution against clearly [^115ahuC3] [^1143Uras] [^116Tkmub].

> Let me synthesize the counseling message and double-check that it aligns with outcomes data. The major risk to discuss is the markedly increased risk of opioid overdose, including fatal overdose, after naltrexone is discontinued due to loss of tolerance, with additional counseling to avoid attempts to override the antagonist blockade and to ensure naloxone access and training for the patient and supports; maintaining treatment continuity reduces overdose risk across MOUD generally, underscoring the importance of retention and proactive transition planning if stopping XR-NTX is considered [^116Tkmub] [^112vRs18] [^116HPtYE] [^111fUnf3].

---

The most significant risk with monthly IM naltrexone (Vivitrol) is **increased risk of opioid overdose** if the patient attempts to override the blockade [^116Tkmub] or relapses after discontinuation, due to reduced tolerance [^112vRs18] [^111fUnf3]. The nurse practitioner must counsel the patient that naltrexone's blockade is surmountable with high opioid doses [^116Tkmub], and that **overdose risk is highest after stopping or missing injections** [^112vRs18] because even small opioid doses can cause respiratory depression or death. Patients and families should be educated on this risk [^116Tkmub], provided naloxone [^116HPtYE] [^112vRs18], and advised to avoid opioid use during and after treatment.

---

## Mechanism of increased overdose risk

Naltrexone is a competitive opioid receptor antagonist that blocks opioid effects [^112cf9qz]. Patients may attempt to override the blockade with large opioid doses, creating a **risk of overdose** when the blockade is incomplete or waning [^116Tkmub]. After discontinuation or missed injections, **tolerance drops rapidly** [^116Tkmub], so previously tolerated doses can cause severe respiratory depression or death [^111fUnf3].

---

## Clinical evidence of overdose risk

- **Overdose events**: In three large pragmatic trials, overdose events occurred in 5.3% of naltrexone-assigned patients [^113E8PBy], with higher risk among those never inducted or who discontinued early.
- **Post-treatment risk**: Overdose risk is highest after stopping naltrexone [^116Tkmub], when patients may use previously tolerated doses despite reduced tolerance [^111fUnf3].
- **Fatal outcomes**: Fatal overdoses have been reported [^116Tkmub] after discontinuation or attempts to override the blockade.

---

## Patient education and counseling

- **Blockade is surmountable**: Patients may attempt to override the blockade [^116Tkmub] with large opioid doses, risking overdose.
- **Post-treatment sensitivity**: After discontinuation or missed injections, tolerance drops [^116Tkmub] and even small opioid doses can cause severe respiratory depression or death [^111fUnf3].
- **Family education**: Inform family and close contacts about increased sensitivity [^116Tkmub] and overdose risk after stopping naltrexone.
- **Naloxone provision**: Provide naloxone [^116HPtYE] and train patients and families in its use [^112vRs18].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize addressing **overdose risk** with XR-NTX. ASAM 2020 [^112vRs18] advises informing patients discontinuing naltrexone of **increased overdose risk** and discussing alternatives (methadone, buprenorphine) and naloxone. The VA/DoD 2021 guideline recommends considering XR-NTX for OUD with **careful patient selection and monitoring** [^111T3FGE]. CRISM 2024 recommends oral naltrexone only for patients who have withdrawn from opioids and decline standard treatments [^115tEaTB].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Careful induction**: Ensure patients are opioid-free [^116Tkmub] before initiation to avoid precipitated withdrawal [^115ahuC3].
- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor adherence [^111DMf4r] and provide ongoing counseling on overdose risk [^112vRs18].
- **Naloxone access**: Ensure patients and families have naloxone [^116HPtYE] and are trained in its use [^112vRs18].
- **Alternative treatments**: Consider methadone or buprenorphine for patients at high risk of relapse or with difficulty maintaining abstinence [^112EppL2] [^112vRs18].

---

The most significant risk with monthly IM naltrexone is **increased risk of opioid overdose** if patients attempt to override the blockade or relapse after discontinuation, due to reduced tolerance [^116Tkmub]. The nurse practitioner must provide thorough counseling, ensure naloxone access [^116HPtYE], and consider alternative treatments to mitigate this risk [^112vRs18].

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: Vulnerability to opioid overdose.

After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (such as respiratory compromise or arrest and circulatory collapse) if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.

Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose.

There is also the possibility that a patient treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of naltrexone hydrochloride. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade it produces is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade, posing a potential risk to individuals who attempt this.

### Open-label study of injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in healthcare professionals with opioid dependence [^117RyLfm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Antagonist-based treatments combined with psychosocial management are alternatives that avoid some barriers. The use of oral naltrexone is well supported in highly motivated populations or in treatment settings with diligent monitoring to ensure compliance with the oral formulation. Acknowledging the need to improve treatment adherence, the National Institute on Drug Abuse called for the development of a long-acting naltrexone preparation. In 2010, the US FDA approved once-monthly, intramuscular injectable XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse in opioid-dependent individuals. XR-NTX releases naltrexone from microspheres composed of polylactide-co-glycolide, a polymer used in dissolvable surgical sutures.

A multicenter, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy of XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse after detoxification in a general population of opioid-dependent patients. In that 6-month study, patients treated with XR-NTX had a median of 90% confirmed (via urine drug screen) abstinent weeks versus 35% for placebo. Prior studies demonstrated the effectiveness of XR-NTX in the treatment of alcohol dependence as well; XR-NTX is also approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence in abstinent patients.

There have been no prospective studies of an extended-release opioid antagonist in the treatment of opioid dependence among healthcare professionals (HCPs). The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the tolerability and long-term safety of XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse among opioid-dependent HCPs who were enrolled in standard intensive outpatient care.

### Association between dynamic dose increases of buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder and risk of relapse [^1143mNoe]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Dynamic, adaptive pharmacologic treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) has been previously recommended over static dosing to prevent relapse and is aligned with personalized medicine. However, there has been no quantitative evidence demonstrating its advantage. Our objective was to estimate the extent to which a hypothetical intervention that increased buprenorphine dose in response to opioid use would affect the risk of relapse over 24 weeks of follow-up.

- **Design**: A secondary analysis of the buprenorphine arm of an open-label randomized controlled 24-week comparative effectiveness trial conducted from 2014 to 2017.

- **Setting**: Eight community addiction treatment programs in the United States.

- **Participants**: English-speaking adults with DSM-5 OUD, recruited during inpatient admission (n = 270). Participants were mainly white (65%) and male (72%).

- **Intervention(s)**: Participants were treated with daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), with dose based on clinical indication determined by the provider. We examined a hypothetical intervention of increasing the dose in response to opioid use.

- **Measurements**: The outcome was relapse to regular opioid use during the 24 weeks of outpatient treatment, assessed in a survival framework. We estimated the relapse-free survival curves of participants under a hypothetical (i.e. counterfactual) intervention in which their BUP-NX dosage would be increased following their own subject-specific opioid use during the first 12 weeks of treatment versus a hypothetical intervention in which dose would remain constant.

### Morphine sulfate extended release [^1129sxSA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Addiction, abuse, and misuse occur because the use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing and reassess all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Life-threatening respiratory depression may occur with the use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, especially during initiation or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are essential. Instruct patients to swallow morphine sulfate extended-release tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving them can cause the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Accidental ingestion of even one dose of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of morphine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants include the possibility of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The concomitant prescribing of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets and benzodiazepines should be reserved for specific cases.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143nMwq]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) developed definitions for use in clinical trials, which were then incorporated into EU and US law. The ICH (1994) provided the following definitions:

- **Adverse event (AE)**: An AE is defined as "any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product".

- **Serious adverse event (SAE)**: An SAE is defined as "any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect".

These characteristics or consequences must be considered at the time of the event. For example, regarding a life-threatening event, this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which might hypothetically have caused death if it were more severe.

Some medical events may jeopardize the subject or may require an intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.

### Opioid use disorder: Medical treatment options [^111DMf4r]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder is highly prevalent and can be fatal. At least 2.1 million Americans aged 12 years and older had opioid use disorder in 2016, and approximately 47,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2017. Opioid use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition, the treatment of which falls within the scope of family physicians. With appropriate medication-assisted treatment, patients are more likely to enter full recovery.

Methadone and buprenorphine are opioid agonists that reduce mortality, opioid use, and HIV and hepatitis C virus transmission, while increasing treatment retention. Intramuscular naltrexone is not as well studied and is harder to initiate than opioid agonists because of the need to abstain for approximately one week before the first dose; however, among those who start naltrexone, it can reduce opioid use and craving.

Choosing the correct medication for a given patient depends on patient preference, local availability of opioid treatment programs, anticipated effectiveness, and adverse effects. Discontinuation of pharmacotherapy increases the risk of relapse; therefore, patients should be encouraged to continue treatment indefinitely.

Many patients with opioid use disorder are treated in primary care, where effective addiction treatment can be provided. Family physicians are ideally positioned to diagnose opioid use disorder, provide evidence-based treatment with buprenorphine or naltrexone, refer patients for methadone as appropriate, and lead the response to the opioid crisis.

### Extended-release injectable naltrexone for opioid use disorder: A systematic review [^111Tv73G]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

We systematically reviewed the published literature on extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®), a once-per-month injection product to treat opioid use disorder. We addressed the following questions: (1) How successful is induction on XR-NTX; (2) What are adherence rates to XR-NTX; and (3) Does XR-NTX decrease opioid use? Factors associated with these outcomes, as well as overdose rates, were examined.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and utilized Google Scholar for forward citation searches of peer-reviewed papers from January 2006 to June 2017. Studies that included individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder who were offered XR-NTX were included.

- **Results**: We identified and included 34 studies. Pooled estimates showed that XR-NTX induction success was lower in studies involving individuals that required opioid detoxification (62.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.5–70.0%) compared with studies involving individuals already detoxified from opioids (85.0%, 95% CI = 78.0–90.1%). 44.2% (95% CI = 33.1–55.9%) of individuals took all scheduled injections of XR-NTX, which were usually six or fewer. Adherence was higher in prospective investigational studies, conducted according to a study protocol in a research context, compared to retrospective studies of medical records from routine care (6-month rates: 46.7%, 95% CI = 34.5–59.2% versus 10.5%, 95% CI = 4.6–22.4%, respectively). Compared with referral to treatment, XR-NTX reduced opioid use in adults under criminal justice supervision and when administered to inmates before release into the community.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NnPCt]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis found no evidence of a difference in the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) for oral naltrexone compared to placebo. This evidence supports the use of naltrexone in its currently licensed form and provides solid support to contemporary efforts studying naltrexone where it is currently unlicensed.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of opioid use disorder in a national cohort [^112UQycn]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

The risk for all-cause mortality and opioid use disorder (OUD) hospitalization remained reduced when analyzed by the duration of any OUD treatment. Retention in OUD treatment is associated with reduced mortality, a finding also observed in recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Sordo et al. noted that the induction phase of methadone treatment and the period immediately after leaving treatment with both methadone and buprenorphine pose a particularly increased mortality risk. However, we did not find an increased risk of mortality or OUD hospitalization associated with any categorized duration of treatment, although methadone treatment during the first 30 days was not connected with a reduced risk of OUD hospitalization or mortality, unlike other duration categories.

Evans et al. found in their 2015 cohort study that exposure to detoxification and maintenance treatment, compared to being out of treatment, was linked to a lower risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The median observation time was 2.6 years, leading researchers to suggest that longer observation could reinforce the understanding of methadone maintenance treatment's cumulative protective effect. Our results, with over seven years of follow-up, demonstrate that the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly lower across all analyzed categories of treatment duration, with a reduction in risk ranging from 28% to 78%. Thus, our findings enhance the understanding of OUD treatment effectiveness over an extended period and offer critical information to reduce mortality risk in this population.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1143Uras]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatotoxicity may occur.

### Opioid overdose: Risk assessment and mitigation in outpatient treatment [^113vtzWf]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The present clinical case discussion focuses on a patient with comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and chronic pain, who experienced an overdose of heroin. The case illustrates the complex array of risk factors that contribute to overdose risk, discusses the use of naloxone, and highlights the need for further risk mitigation interventions in patients at risk for overdose.

### Management of opioid use disorder: 2024 update to the national clinical practice guideline [^112EppL2]. CMAJ (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, CRISM 2024 guidelines recommend initiating buprenorphine as a standard first-line treatment option for opioid agonist therapy. They recognize the high risk of attrition after the first month of initiation and suggest offering alternative opioid agonist medications in these circumstances.

### Thresholds for adjunctive medication usage and probability of initiating injectable naltrexone [^112hvNji]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

To estimate the effectiveness of different thresholds for administering opioid withdrawal medications (clonidine and clonazepam) on the probability of successfully initiating extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) among participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) during medically managed withdrawal, a secondary analysis of a multisite clinical trial was conducted. The trial compared a rapid versus standard approach for XR-NTX initiation from 2021 to 2022.

The study was set in six community inpatient addiction treatment units in the United States. Participants involved were English-speaking adults seeking treatment for DSM-5 OUD and expressing interest in XR-NTX treatment, totaling 415 individuals.

Measurements focused on the extent to which various thresholds for adjunctive medication administration would affect the probability of initiating XR-NTX over time. These thresholds included:

- **Administration in response to mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms or greater**: Using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 5 or more.
- **Administration in response to minimal withdrawal symptoms or greater**: Using a COWS score of 3 or more.
- **Administration regardless of withdrawal symptoms**.

Using a longitudinal sequentially doubly robust estimator, the study estimated the cumulative probability of XR-NTX initiation under each of these three treatment regimes, accounting for dropout and initiation of other medications as competing events.

- **Findings**:
	- The estimated probability of initiating XR-NTX by day 14 was 50.4% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 41.8% to 58.9% under the no-threshold regime. For other thresholds, the probability was 43.9% with a 95% CI of 39.1%.

### SPL drug information for naltrexone hydrochloride [^116WjGnU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

When using naltrexone hydrochloride PO, there are some important warnings and precautions to consider:

- **Drug withdrawal syndrome**: Use caution in patients with physiological opioid dependence.
- **Suicidal ideation**: Exercise caution in patients with a history of depression or suicide attempts.

### Cost-effectiveness of extended release naltrexone to prevent relapse among criminal justice-involved individuals with a history of opioid use disorder [^115e2S7i]. Addiction (2017). High credibility.

Criminal justice-involved individuals are highly susceptible to opioid relapse and overdose-related deaths. In a recent randomized trial, we demonstrated the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; Vivitrol®) in preventing opioid relapse among criminal justice-involved US adults with a history of opioid use disorder. The cost of XR-NTX may be a significant barrier to adoption; thus, it is important to account for improved quality of life and downstream cost-offsets. Our aims were to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for XR-NTX versus treatment as usual (TAU) and evaluate it relative to generally accepted value thresholds, and to estimate the incremental cost per additional year of opioid abstinence.

- **Design**: Economic evaluation of the aforementioned trial from the taxpayer perspective. Participants were randomized to 25 weeks of XR-NTX injections or TAU; follow-up occurred at 52 and 78 weeks.

- **Setting**: Five study sites in the US Northeast corridor.

- **Participants**: A total of 308 participants were randomized to XR-NTX (n = 153) or TAU (n = 155).

- **Measurements**: Incremental costs relative to incremental economic and clinical effectiveness measures, QALYs and abstinent years, respectively.

- **Findings**: The 25-week cost per QALY and abstinent-year figures were $162,150 and $46,329, respectively. The 78-week figures were $76,400/QALY and $16,371/abstinent year. At 25 weeks, we can be 10% certain that XR-NTX is cost-effective at a value threshold of $100,000/QALY and 62% certain at $200,000/QALY.

### Diagnosis and treatment of presumed naltrexone-XR-precipitated opioid withdrawal in a patient chronically treated with buprenorphine-XR: A case report [^111HRQdt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone are Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder in the United States. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, can precipitate opioid withdrawal if administered too quickly after the use of full or partial opioid agonists for those with either dependence or use disorder. We describe a case of severe precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome after reported buprenorphine extended-release (XR) administration, despite the patient having been stable on buprenorphine-XR for several years, with no missed doses or recent opioid use. Naltrexone levels were sent and helped to diagnose suspected inadvertent naltrexone-XR administration in this patient, which was likely the etiology of his precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome. We suggest the use of high-dose buprenorphine, as well as adjunctive medications including benzodiazepines, as a treatment strategy for naltrexone-XR precipitated withdrawal in the setting of chronic buprenorphine-XR treatment.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112TFLLb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend administering extended-release injectable naltrexone every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection into the gluteal muscle at a set dosage of 380 mg per injection. Consider administering naltrexone every 3 weeks in selected patients, such as those metabolizing naltrexone more rapidly.

### Unintentional rapid opioid detoxification [^115Vv5j7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid antagonist used in rehabilitation programs to maintain heroin abstinence. It is a relatively new drug prescribed by specialists in substance misuse. Its actions and effects may not be familiar to many accident and emergency doctors, or even to the individuals who take it. A case report is described where accidental ingestion of naltrexone results in a medical emergency by precipitating acute withdrawal in a heroin addict.

### Open-label study of injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in healthcare professionals with opioid dependence [^114JdrNv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Extended-release opioid antagonist treatment could provide additional protection against cue-induced craving and relapse and is consistent with the recovery-oriented approach favored by most professional societies governing the treatment of opioid-dependent healthcare professionals (HCPs). Effective use of oral naltrexone among opioid-dependent HCPs requires consistent and voluntary self-administration, usually daily or at least three times per week. In general populations with opioid dependence, adherence to oral naltrexone is low, such that its efficacy has generally been no better than placebo.

However, in a study of highly motivated professionals, including HCPs, 74% of opioid-dependent physicians treated with six months of oral naltrexone were abstinent and returned to their practice in 12 months. The authors noted that naltrexone may have provided specific benefits to physicians' ability to focus on recovery and work and potentially ensured reduced suspicion and doubt within the legal community and among medical colleagues on return to work. In other structured programs with naltrexone (including XR-NTX), long-term abstinence rates of up to 94% have been observed.

These promising findings among safety-sensitive HCPs argue persuasively for broader evaluation of XR-NTX in the large and growing population of opioid-dependent individuals, which has reached epidemic status. It is noteworthy that only 8 of 519 urine drug screens revealed any opioid use in the present study. Among those who remained on XR-NTX, there were no relapses to opioid dependence over the 24-month period.

### Sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence [^112cf9qz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Opioid dependence is a severe and often lifelong disorder with a high risk of overdose and premature death, as well as severe psychosocial difficulties. Sustained-release naltrexone is a treatment option that works by blocking the euphoric and overdose effects of opioids. When injected intramuscularly, naltrexone provides a blockade for one month, while the blocking effects with implants can last for up to six months.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of sustained-release naltrexone for the treatment of opioid dependence.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched the following databases from 2007 up to 20 December 2023: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialised Register of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We manually searched the reference lists of identified studies, published reviews and relevant websites.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of injectable or implantable naltrexone with other treatment, no treatment or placebo in adults with opioid dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Primary outcomes were illicit opioid use, retention in treatment, treatment acceptability, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were opioid craving, recreational use of substances other than opioids, mental health, quality of life, and criminal activity. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1).

### A randomized trial comparing extended-release injectable suspension and oral naltrexone, both combined with behavioral therapy, for the treatment of opioid use disorder [^117FqdDv]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The oral formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone has shown limited effectiveness for treatment of opioid use disorder due to poor adherence. Long-acting injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone), administered monthly, circumvents the need for daily pill taking, potentially improving adherence, and has been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing opioid use over 6 months of treatment. This open-label trial compared the outcomes of patients with opioid use disorder treated with XR-naltrexone or oral naltrexone in combination with behavioral therapy.

- **Method**: Sixty opioid-dependent adults completed inpatient opioid withdrawal and were transitioned to oral naltrexone. They were stratified by severity of opioid use (six or fewer bags versus more than six bags of heroin per day) and randomly assigned (1:1) to continue treatment with oral naltrexone (N = 32) or XR-naltrexone (N = 28) for 24 weeks. The first dose of XR-naltrexone (380 mg) was administered prior to discharge, with monthly doses thereafter, and oral naltrexone was given in a 50-mg daily dose. All participants received weekly behavioral therapy to support treatment and adherence to naltrexone.

- **Results**: A Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for race, gender, route of use, and baseline opioid use severity indicated that significantly more patients were retained in treatment for 6 months in the XR-naltrexone group (16 of 28 patients, 57.1%) than in the oral naltrexone group (nine of 32 patients, 28.1%) [hazard ratio = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.07, 4.43].

- **Conclusions**: Patients receiving XR-naltrexone had twice the retention rate in treatment compared to those receiving oral naltrexone.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^11323dNr]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

The HIV clinic care team and research staff recruited participants from their HIV clinics and interacted with community and hospital-based outreach services to identify and engage potential participants outside the HIV clinic. Potential participants received an overview of opioid agonist and antagonist therapies and, with verbal consent, completed a pre-screening interview to assess initial eligibility. Potentially eligible participants then completed written informed consent and screening, including laboratory testing, and were randomized to treatment conditions if eligible.

Participants assigned to office-based XR-NTX underwent medically supervised withdrawal and naltrexone induction in outpatient or residential settings in accordance with the package insert and published outpatient protocols. XR-NTX (4 ml, 380 mg of naltrexone base) was administered as a gluteal intramuscular injection (alternating sides monthly) at induction (week 0) and at treatment weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 for a maximum of six doses.

Participants assigned to the TAU group were offered the standard treatment for OUD provided at each HIV clinic. All clinics offered opioid agonist treatment services (buprenorphine or methadone), with the schedule of medical care and behavioral support determined by the treating provider. Study clinicians provided all participants medical management, a brief counseling intervention delivered by medical providers to improve patient responses to MOUD treatments delivered in medical settings.

Participants completed urine drug screens (UDS) and surveys.

### American society of addiction medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112q8rXV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Those on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort. In contrast, patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort when switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before they can receive naltrexone. This process may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, particularly the increased risk of death.

- **Buprenorphine introduction**: Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

### The Food and Drug Administration and varenicline: Should risk communication be improved [^116uW9Pq]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Effective regulation must balance all evidence regarding efficacy and safety, even when evidence is sparse and potentially unreliable. False positive signals discovered in case reports can be damaging. A cautionary example in this context is the reduced uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine after it was incorrectly linked to autism.

- **Implications for varenicline**: The Black Box warnings issued for varenicline may have confused smokers and physicians about the strength of the scientific evidence regarding varenicline's neuropsychiatric risks. This confusion arises because they may have interpreted the Black Box warning as reporting causal adverse drug reactions. Consequently, fewer people are likely to have been prescribed varenicline due to these warnings. Sales of varenicline fell steadily from 2007 to 2014 after adjusting for inflation. While we cannot be certain how the FDA's warning affected prescribing, the safety concerns may have led to fewer people quitting smoking.

In addition, Pfizer has been subject to litigation in the United States over potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects of varenicline, which they settled out of court at a cost of US$288 million. Few may have sympathy for a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical company, given the well-documented misdeeds of "Big Pharma". Nonetheless, Black Box warnings can impose significant costs on companies developing new treatments and potentially reduce innovation.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: A 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^113JBiEj]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

There are three classes of medication for the treatment of opioid dependence (ICD‐10): full agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists. While agonists have been used worldwide for many years, long‐acting injectable versions of the opioid antagonist naltrexone are so far only approved in the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. Administered as monthly intramuscular injections, extended‐release naltrexone (XR‐NTX) blocks the euphoric effects of opioids and offers medication‐assisted abstinence from opioids. Studies have shown that XR‐NTX is an effective, safe, and feasible treatment option. However, the majority of studies on XR‐NTX treatment have had limited time frames, and only a few studies have reported results from 12 months or longer. To our knowledge, there are no recommendations regarding clinical treatment length with XR‐NTX based on research or national guidelines.

Opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OMT), which is the World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended treatment for opioid dependence, is recommended to be open‐ended and, at least in Western Europe, OMT has become a long‐lasting or even lifelong treatment. Opioid agonist treatment and XR‐NTX treatment differ in a number of ways. While opioid agonists maintain the opioid dependence, XR‐NTX blocks the effects of opioids and supports abstinence from all opioids. Two randomized controlled trials suggested that XR‐NTX is equally as effective as the opioid agonist buprenorphine–naloxone (BP‐NLX) in short‐term treatment with regard to retention in treatment and reduction in the use of illicit opioids.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115WhpP]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used in many different conditions, both licensed and unlicensed. It is used at widely varying doses from 3 to 250 mg. The aim of this review was to extensively evaluate the safety of oral naltrexone by examining the risk of serious adverse events and adverse events in randomised controlled trials of naltrexone compared to placebo.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, other databases, and clinical trials registries was undertaken up to May 2018. Parallel placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials longer than 4 weeks, published after 1 January 2001, of oral naltrexone at any dose were selected. Any condition or age group was included, excluding only studies in opioid or ex-opioid users owing to possible opioid/opioid antagonist interactions. The systematic review used the guidance of the Cochrane Handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses harms checklist throughout. Numerical data were independently extracted by two people and cross-checked. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed in R using random effects models throughout.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine randomised controlled trials with 11,194 participants were found, studying alcohol use disorders (n = 38), various psychiatric disorders (n = 13), impulse control disorders (n = 9), other addictions including smoking (n = 18), obesity or eating disorders (n = 6), Crohn's disease (n = 2), fibromyalgia (n = 1), and cancers (n = 2).

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, particularly concerning methadone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines do not recommend a specific time limit for pharmacological treatment with methadone due to insufficient evidence. It is essential to inform patients discontinuing methadone treatment about the risks associated with opioid overdose, particularly the heightened risk of overdose death if they relapse into illicit opioid use. Discuss treatment alternatives, including buprenorphine and naltrexone, and educate about opioid overdose prevention with naloxone for any patient choosing to discontinue treatment.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^11439BLC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methadone is a treatment option recommended for patients who are physiologically dependent on opioids, able to give informed consent, and who have no specific contraindications for agonist treatment when it is administered in the context of an appropriate plan. This plan should include psychosocial intervention.

The recommended initial dose for methadone ranges from 10 to 30 mg, with reassessment in 3–4 hours, and a second dose not to exceed 10 mg on the first day if withdrawal symptoms persist. Federal law mandates that the initial dose cannot exceed 30 mg.

The usual daily dosage of methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder ranges from 60 to 120 mg. Some patients may respond to lower doses, while others may need higher doses. To prevent oversedation, toxicity, or even iatrogenic overdose deaths, dosage increases should be in 5–10 mg increments and applied no more frequently than every 7 days, depending on clinical response. There is no recommended time limit for treatment.

Administration of methadone must be monitored, as unsupervised administration can lead to misuse and diversion. OTP regulations require monitored medication administration until the patient's clinical response and behavior demonstrate that unmonitored dosing is appropriate.

Psychosocial treatment, though sometimes minimally needed, should be implemented in conjunction with the use of methadone for treating opioid use disorder.

Methadone should be reinstituted immediately if relapse occurs or when an assessment determines that treatment is needed again.

### Open-label study of injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in healthcare professionals with opioid dependence [^116mrcGP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) with opioid dependence are at risk for relapse and death, particularly in the first year of recovery. Maintenance treatment with opioid agonists is controversial in this safety-sensitive group. We evaluated long-term safety, tolerability, and treatment outcomes of injectable, intramuscular, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in opioid-dependent HCPs.

This single-arm, multisite, open-label study was conducted in opioid-dependent HCPs who had been detoxified from opioids for at least 2 weeks. Subjects received monthly XR-NTX injections for up to 24 months, combined with counseling via intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. Assessments included monthly urine opioid drug tests and routine safety assessments, along with a trimonthly short form (36) Health Survey, opioid craving questionnaire, and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication.

Of 49 opioid-dependent HCPs screened, 38 enrolled and received at least one XR-NTX injection. Most participants were female (n = 31) and worked as nurses or nursing assistants (n = 30). More than half (n = 21; 55.3%) received at least 12 injections. Seven participants discontinued due to adverse events, including anxiety (3), headache (2), injection-site mass (1), and derealization (1). None experienced relapses necessitating detoxification, overdose, or death during treatment. At 24 months, mean opioid craving decreased by 45.2%, and short form (36) mental component scores improved by 31.1% from baseline, approaching normal levels. Of 22 unemployed subjects at baseline, 45.5% showed employment improvement.

### The Food and Drug Administration and varenicline: Should risk communication be improved [^114nqttC]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

The only information that is useful for patients making treatment decisions is evidence about the causal effects of medications. This evidence should, ideally, be obtained from an adequately powered randomized trial or meta-analyses of randomized trials. However, there are many instances where randomized trials are not feasible. In the absence of experimental data, regulators should rely upon well-conducted observational studies. At a minimum, these studies should control for a rich set of baseline confounders, use appropriate control groups, and avoid or account for as many potential biases as possible.

Case reports without an adequate control group are unlikely to be sufficient evidence of causation, except when the causal effects are extremely large, the adverse event is very rare, and the adverse events are not related to the potential confounders. However, the incidence of adverse events in treated groups is useful information for prescribers, even if they are not caused by the medication. Should the FDA use Black Box warnings to report information both about the causal effects of medications and patients' baseline risk of adverse events?

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114SNsVa]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly in relation to withdrawal management, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend avoiding opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification due to the high risk of adverse events and death. Consider initiating naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management, but only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method and in cases where anesthesia or conscious sedation is not employed.

### Opioid overdose history, risk behaviors, and knowledge in patients taking prescribed opioids for chronic pain [^111mfNQw]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

More than 100 million adults in the United States experience chronic pain, and prescription opioids are the third most widely prescribed class of medications. Opioid overdose prevention efforts almost exclusively target illicit opioid users, and little is known about the experience of overdose among patients being treated for chronic pain (CP) with a prescription opioid.

Patients experiencing CP for three or more months and receiving a prescription opioid for pain management (N = 502) completed a self-report survey that asked questions about opioid overdose history, past 30-day risk factors, and knowledge of opioid overdose, overdose risk, and naloxone.

Approximately one in five CP participants reported experiencing a lifetime overdose. CP participants reported engaging in several behaviors associated with overdose risk and were unlikely to have been trained to administer naloxone. Fewer than 50% of participants answered any knowledge item correctly. The likelihood of having experienced an overdose increased as the scores on the SOAPP-R and DSM-5 opioid use disorder checklist increased, and a SOAPP-R score of 7 or higher or meeting DSM-5 mild opioid use disorder criteria were significantly associated with reporting a lifetime overdose (85% and 84% of participants who experienced an overdose, respectively).

Opioid overdose occurs at a high rate among CP participants, and this group is relatively uninformed about risk factors for overdose. Established SOAPP-R and DSM thresholds provide an opportunity to identify participants at risk.

### The Food and Drug Administration and varenicline: Should risk communication be improved [^114q1WUn]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Patients and clinicians are likely to interpret the FDA Black Box warning about serious neuropsychiatric adverse events as implying a causal effect of varenicline. This warning does not reflect scientific evidence accurately and should be revised.

On 11 May 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved varenicline (Chantix, Champix) for use in smoking cessation; it was the first oral non‐nicotine treatment licensed by the FDA since bupropion in 1997. However, it was not long before concerns were raised about the neuropsychiatric safety of the medicine. Anecdotal reports from popular press and internet sites, in addition to post‐marketing case reports and reports to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), suggested that some patients prescribed varenicline had experienced suicidal behaviour. As a result, in November 2007, the FDA announced that they were conducting two safety reviews of varenicline's associations with suicidality and neuropsychiatric adverse events not related to suicidality. Findings from these reviews were published in 2008, with the FDA concluding that "[varenicline] may cause worsening of a psychiatric illness even if it is currently under control and may cause an old psychiatric illness to reoccur". In July 2009, the FDA went further, mandating that varenicline carry a "Black Box warning". These warnings highlighted "the risk of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients using these products". Symptoms included changes in behaviour, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, and behavior.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^115ahuC3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids or to avoid exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

- **Switching from buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, or methadone**: There are no systematically collected data specifically addressing the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride; however, a review of postmarketing case reports indicates that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when switching from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy (see WARNINGS). Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

- **Treatment of alcoholism**: A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment for alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

### Management of opioid use disorder in the United States: present status and future directions [^112CtGLg]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder is characterized by the persistent use of opioids despite adverse consequences. The disorder is associated with a range of mental and general medical comorbid conditions and increased mortality. While genetics play a role in opioid use disorder, factors such as younger age, male sex, lower educational attainment, and income increase the risk. Certain psychiatric disorders, including other substance use disorders and mood disorders, also contribute.

Medications for opioid use disorder, such as methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone, significantly enhance outcomes. Despite this, their effectiveness is hindered by issues at all stages of the care cascade, including diagnosis, entry into treatment, and retention. There is a pressing need to expand the use of these medications, train healthcare professionals in both treatment and prevention, and develop alternative medications and new care models to offer personalized interventions.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes measures to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following the naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours. The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

	- **Intravenous**:
		- Inject 0.2 mg naloxone.
		- Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal.
		- If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone.
		- Observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### Percocet [^116P4zse]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration instructions**: Percocet should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see warnings]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Percocet for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g. the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see warnings].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Percocet. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see warnings].

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Belbuca for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Belbuca. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Belbuca buccal film is for oral buccal use only and is to be applied to the buccal mucosa every 12 hours. Instruct patients not to use Belbuca if the pouch seal is broken or the buccal film is cut, damaged, or changed in any way and to avoid applying Belbuca to areas of the mouth with any open sores or lesions.

### Opioid use and dropout from extended-release naltrexone in a controlled trial: Implications for mechanism [^111B967m]. Addiction (2020). High credibility.

Extended-release formulations of naltrexone have emerged as effective treatment options for opioid use disorder. This post-hoc analysis examined the temporal relationship between episodes of opioid use and subsequent dropout in a placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) to draw inferences about the mechanism by which extended blockade of opioid receptors translates into clinical effectiveness.

- **Design**: This was a 24-week multiple-site, double-blind, randomized trial of monthly XR-NTX versus placebo injections. We analyzed time to dropout from treatment using survival analysis with an extended Cox model as a function of treatment (XR-NTX versus placebo) and with weekly urine drug test (UDT) results for opioids at each week as a time-dependent covariate.

- **Setting**: Thirteen addiction treatment programs in Russia, 2008–09.

- **Participants**: A total of 250 adults with opioid use disorder who had completed in-patient detoxification.

- **Intervention**: XR-NTX injection or placebo injection every 4 weeks with weekly clinic visits and biweekly counseling.

- **Measurements**: Urine toxicology for opioids measured weekly and week of dropout from treatment.

- **Findings**: The Cox model yielded a significant interaction of time-dependent urine toxicology by treatment (P = 0.024). Among patients receiving placebo, a positive UDT in a given week increased the risk for dropout from treatment in the subsequent week [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.6–10.0], whereas among patients receiving XR-NTX, a positive UDT result showed.

### Treatment of opioid-use disorders [^116GfLm7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on opioid use disorder:

- **Definition**: OUD is defined as a pattern of recurring opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress.

- **Pathophysiology**: The positive reinforcing effects of opioid use are mediated by indirect downstream activation of dopamine receptors. Repeated use ultimately leads to physiological dependence with tolerance, and withdrawal if use is ceased.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the rates of past-year non-medical opioid use, heroin use, and heroin abuse are estimated at 4,240, 260, and 190 per 100,000 persons, respectively.

- **Disease course**: The development of opioid dependence mirrors other drug dependencies. Possible warning signs may include changes in peer group, decreasing involvement in social or leisure activities, isolation from family or old friends, mood changes, and increased frequency of negative behaviors, including criminal acts. Development of tolerance leads to consumption of escalating opioid doses, which increases the risk of respiratory depression and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: OUD is associated with an increase in mortality, with an estimated standardized mortality ratio of 14.66 (95% CI, 12.82–16.50). In the US, out of 100 daily deaths due to drug overdose, nearly 50 deaths are due to prescription opioids, and 20 are due to heroin overdose.

Psychosocial treatment should be implemented in conjunction with the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder. This therapy may be provided by the prescribing clinician or by a separate therapist, depending on the clinical situation and the skills and training of the prescribing clinician.

- **Reduction of buprenorphine diversion**: Clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion. Recommended strategies include frequent office visits (weekly in early treatment), urine drug testing (including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites), and recall visits for pill counts.

- **Frequent testing and monitoring**: Patients should be tested frequently for buprenorphine, other substances, and prescription medications. Accessing Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data may be useful for monitoring other medications that the patient may be receiving. Due to the variation in state PDMP laws, clinicians are encouraged to be familiar with the legal requirements associated with PDMPs and prescribing controlled substances in their state.

- **Frequency of patient visits**: Patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of their treatment. Weekly visits (at least) are recommended until patients are determined to be stable. There is no recommended time limit for treatment.

- **Buprenorphine tapering and discontinuation**: Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process, indefinite in duration, and close monitoring should be done even after buprenorphine is stopped. Buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months. Patients should be encouraged to remain in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of discontinuation.

### Oral vs extended-release injectable naltrexone for hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^114LNhLw]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Nearly 8% of people aged 12 years or older in the US have alcohol use disorder (AUD). Unfortunately, 94% of those with AUD do not receive medication or counseling. A setting in which to expand AUD treatment is the hospital, where one survey found 19% of inpatients have AUD. Few are discharged with medication or referrals to treatment, increasing acute care readmission.

Pharmacotherapies and manualized psychotherapies are the main AUD treatments. Given the moderate benefit of AUD medication, optimizing its delivery could improve outcomes. Naltrexone, the most commonly used AUD medication, is available as an oral daily tablet or a monthly injection. Both formulations should be given with medical management, which includes the review of alcohol consumption, counseling, assessment of liver enzymes, and monitoring of medication adverse effects (AEs).

Extended-release injectable naltrexone obviates the need for daily pill-taking, potentially offering an advantage over oral naltrexone. However, patients may prefer daily pill-taking to monthly injections due to the time and effort required for injection visits, negative attitudes towards injections, and greater control over the use of naltrexone. Extended-release injectable naltrexone is more costly ($1064.00 for one injection versus $38.10 for 30 days of oral naltrexone); however, cost-effectiveness could be similar if extended-release injectable naltrexone were more effective with less health care utilization.

Initiating naltrexone at hospital discharge is feasible, yet to our knowledge, no published randomized clinical trial has compared oral naltrexone and extended-release injectable naltrexone under these circumstances.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: A 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^116kF1C2]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

Extended-release naltrexone seems to be effective, well-tolerated, and feasible in long-term treatment up to 3 years. Clinicians should be attentive to patients' needs and preferences; XR-NTX treatment should be individually tailored with regard to duration and content.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: A 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^1176wy7F]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of short-term treatment with XR-NTX is well documented; however, documentation on long-term treatment is lacking. In our study, we found a very high tolerability, with very few and transient non-serious adverse effects, and none of the participants terminated treatment due to tolerability issues. Our data suggest that XR-NTX is also safe and well tolerated in long-term treatment.

The patients' characteristics corresponded well with the total sample of the parent study. When entering the parent study, a limited number of participants were already in recovery in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) and not using illicit substances, while a majority reported ongoing illicit substance use and serious addiction-related problems. Opioid-dependent individuals who are already in recovery in OMT may need XR-NTX in a shorter transition phase to achieve medication-free abstinence over time. In contrast, those who have an ongoing opioid addiction and addiction-related problems are likely to need longer-term treatment.

Participants' abstinence from or use of opioids identified early in the study was very likely to be maintained throughout their study period. The relatively low number of participants in the study may have prevented us from identifying groups with clear changes in patterns of opioid use, as seen in other studies. However, the fact that a number of participants continued their opioid use during the study emphasizes the importance of XR-NTX treatment being reinforced by psychosocial interventions, as recommended for OMT. The participants who used opioids chose to continue XR-NTX treatment, although the reasons behind this decision require further investigation.

### Open-label study of injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in healthcare professionals with opioid dependence [^115TZfLj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) with opioid dependence are at risk for relapse and death, particularly in the first year of recovery; however, maintenance treatment with opioid agonists is controversial in this safety-sensitive group. This study evaluated the long-term safety, tolerability, and treatment outcomes of injectable, intramuscular, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in opioid-dependent HCPs.

This single-arm, multisite, open-label study was conducted in opioid-dependent HCPs who had been detoxified from opioids for at least two weeks. Subjects received monthly XR-NTX injections for up to 24 months, combined with counseling via intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. Assessments included monthly urine opioid drug tests and routine safety assessments, along with a trimonthly short form (36) Health Survey, opioid craving questionnaire, and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication.

Of 49 opioid-dependent HCPs screened, 38 enrolled and received at least one XR-NTX injection. Most were female (n = 31) and were nurses or nursing assistants (n = 30). More than half (n = 21; 55.3%) received at least 12 injections. Seven discontinued due to adverse events: three due to anxiety, two due to headaches, one injection-site mass, and one due to derealization. None experienced relapses to opioid dependence necessitating detoxification, overdose, or death during treatment. At 24 months, mean opioid craving fell by 45.2%, and short form (36) mental component scores improved by 31.1% from baseline, approaching normal levels. Of the 22 unemployed subjects at baseline, 45.5% showed improvement by the end of the study period.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116NfGsS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, and more specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend administering extended-release injectable naltrexone for preventing relapse in patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids, are able to give informed consent, and have no contraindications for this treatment.

### American Society of addiction medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^117RMEpu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinicians should consider treating adolescents who have opioid use disorder using the full range of treatment options, including pharmacotherapy. Opioid agonists (methadone and buprenorphine) and antagonists (naltrexone) may be considered for treatment of opioid use disorder in adolescents. Age is a consideration in treatment, and federal laws and US FDA approvals need to be considered for patients under the age of 18. Buprenorphine is US FDA-approved for adolescents aged 16 years and above.

Psychosocial treatment is recommended in the treatment of adolescents with opioid use disorder. Practices to reduce infection (e.g. sexual risk reduction interventions) are recommended as components of comprehensive treatment for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses. Adolescents may benefit from treatment in specialized treatment facilities that provide multidimensional services.

A comprehensive assessment including determination of mental health status should evaluate whether the patient is stable. Patients with suicidal or homicidal ideation should be referred immediately for treatment and possibly hospitalization. Management of patients at risk for suicide should include the following: reducing immediate risk; managing underlying factors associated with suicidal intent; and monitoring and follow-up.

All patients with psychiatric disorders should be asked about suicidal ideation and behavior.

### Frequency of early refills for opioids in the United States [^112bcaxs]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

With the increase in opioid abuse and deaths due to overdose in recent decades, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved the extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) Opioid Analgesics Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) on July 9, 2012, to support national efforts to address the opioid crisis and to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks when opioid products are prescribed. The primary goal of the REMS program was to reduce adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse, and abuse of ER/LA opioids. The ER/LA Opioid Analgesics REMS was expanded to include immediate-release and short-acting (IR/SA) opioid analgesics and was renamed the "Opioid Analgesic REMS" on September 18, 2018. This study was conducted to support the ER/LA Opioid Analgesics REMS program.

Prescription drugs are implicated in the increased rates of opioid overdose. Prior work has found that refilling an opioid prescription early is a more important risk factor for prescription opioid abuse than nonopioid substance abuse, dose escalation, number of pharmacies where an opioid was filled, and all other variables assessed. Early refills of an opioid are also associated with risk factors of opioid misuse. Due to the risk of opioid abuse and misuse associated with refilling opioid prescriptions early, it is vital to understand the scope of this behavior. We conducted a study to quantify the frequency of this behavior and assess whether it is common enough to justify future studies examining the reasons for this action.

### Severe opioid withdrawal precipitated by Vivitrol® [^111Pfd8p]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The risk of severe precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) is amplified when precipitated by a long-acting opioid antagonist. Intramuscular extended-release naltrexone (XRNTX; Vivitrol®) is an FDA-approved therapy for preventing relapse of opioid and alcohol abuse. Two cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal from XRNTX are presented that illustrate different patient reactions to POW.

A 56-year-old woman developed a hypertensive emergency and required continuous intravenous vasodilators, clonidine, and intensive care monitoring after re-initiation of XRNTX following opioid relapse. A 25-year-old man developed agitation and altered mental status after receiving XRNTX at the conclusion of a twelve-day detoxification program during which he continued surreptitious use of heroin. The patient received benzodiazepines and haloperidol without adequate effect and required intubation with propofol, lorazepam, and dexmedetomidine infusions.

Management of POW from XRNTX remains a challenge for emergency providers, as protocols to guide management are lacking. Recommended therapies include intravenous fluids, anti-emetics, clonidine, benzodiazepines, and therapy tailored to the affected organ system. To minimize the risk of POW, it is important for providers instituting XRNTX to adhere to the manufacturer's warnings and clinical protocols, including a naloxone challenge and ensuring an adequate opioid-free period prior to administration of XRNTX.

### Duration of medication treatment for opioid-use disorder and risk of overdose among Medicaid enrollees in 11 states: a retrospective cohort study [^111fUnf3]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) reduces harms associated with opioid use disorder (OUD), including the risk of overdose. Understanding how variation in MOUD duration influences overdose risk is important as health-care payers increasingly remove barriers to treatment continuation, such as prior authorization. This study measured the association between MOUD continuation, relative to discontinuation, and opioid-related overdose among Medicaid beneficiaries.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study using landmark survival analysis. We estimated the association between treatment continuation and overdose risk at five points after the index, or first, MOUD claim. Censoring events included death and disenrollment.

- **Setting and Participants**: Medicaid programs in 11 U.S. states: Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. A total of 293,180 Medicaid beneficiaries aged 18–64 years with a diagnosis of OUD had a first MOUD claim between 2016 and 2017.

- **Measurements**: MOUD formulations included methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. We measured medically treated opioid-related overdose within claims within 12 months of the index MOUD claim.

- **Findings**: Results were consistent across states. In pooled results, 5.1% of beneficiaries had an overdose, and 67% discontinued MOUD before an overdose or censoring event within 12 months. Beneficiaries who continued MOUD beyond 60 days had a lower relative overdose hazard ratio (HR) compared with those who discontinued by day 60 [HR = 0.39; 95% confidence interval].

### Risk of experiencing an overdose event for patients undergoing treatment with medication for opioid use disorder [^113E8PBy]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The overdose risk during a course of treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) has not been clearly delineated. The authors sought to address this gap by leveraging a new data set from three large pragmatic clinical trials of MOUD.

- **Methods**: Adverse event logs, including overdose events from the three trials (N = 2,199), were harmonized. The overall risk of having an overdose event in the 24 weeks after randomization was compared for each study arm (one methadone, one naltrexone, and three buprenorphine groups) using survival analysis with time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models.

- **Results**: By week 24, 39 participants had one or more overdose events. The frequency of having an overdose event was 15 (5.30%) among 283 patients assigned to naltrexone, eight (1.51%) among 529 patients assigned to methadone, and 16 (1.15%) among 1,387 patients assigned to buprenorphine. Notably, 27.9% of patients assigned to extended-release naltrexone never initiated the medication, with an overdose rate of 8.9% (7/79), compared to 3.9% (8/204) among those who initiated naltrexone. Controlling for sociodemographic and time-varying medication adherence variables and baseline substance use, a proportional hazard model did not show a significant effect of naltrexone assignment. Significantly higher probabilities of experiencing an overdose event were observed among patients with baseline benzodiazepine use (hazard ratio = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.76, 6.42) and those who were never inducted on their assigned study medication (hazard ratio = 6.64, 95% CI = 2.12, 19.54).

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of substance use disorders [^112H9JZw]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, particularly with naltrexone, the 2021 DoD/VA guidelines suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of oral naltrexone in the treatment of OUD.
