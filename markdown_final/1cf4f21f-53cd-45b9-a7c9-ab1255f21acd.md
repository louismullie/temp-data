## Question

stage 5 ckd prognosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prognosis in stage 5 CKD, including survival with dialysis versus conservative management, key modifiers, and how to communicate and use prognostic tools in shared decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how stage 5 CKD is defined and why prognosis is heterogeneous. Then, I should quantify survival differences between dialysis and conservative management overall and in subgroups. Next, I will examine the major modifiers of prognosis and competing risks. After that, I should review validated prognostic tools and guideline thresholds. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, patient-centered communication and decision framework, while double-checking for potential biases and uncertainties in the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline risk context. Stage 5 CKD is defined by eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² for at least 3 months, and it carries the highest risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality across all albuminuria categories, with cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death in advanced CKD, which frames the competing-risk landscape I need to keep in mind during counseling [^112U7pQ8] [^117NcKTA] [^notfound].

> Now, I should quantify survival with dialysis versus conservative management in general cohorts. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of difference. In a large 18-year cohort, median survival from entry into stage 5 was 67.1 months with renal replacement therapy versus 21.2 months with conservative management, indicating a substantial survival advantage for dialysis overall, though this advantage attenuates with age and comorbidity and must be interpreted in light of selection and lead-time biases inherent to observational designs [^116CL7kp] [^112n5Zkj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for older adults. In patients over 75, the survival advantage of dialysis narrows markedly. In one analysis, after adjustment for age, diabetes, and comorbidity, the median survival difference was only about 4 months and not statistically significant, and in those with high comorbidity, particularly ischemic heart disease, the survival curves converge, suggesting little to no survival benefit from dialysis in this subgroup [^111S88yf] [^116VhX4N]. I should double-check that this pattern is consistent across studies; indeed, a systematic review similarly found that for patients aged 80 and older or those with severe comorbidity, the survival benefit of dialysis over conservative kidney management essentially disappears, reinforcing the need for individualized decision-making in this population [^11399TQL].

> Next, I should review quality of life and symptom trajectories, because survival alone may not capture what matters most to patients. Let me consider the data carefully. Conservative management often yields comparable or better quality of life, fewer hospitalizations, and more home deaths, whereas dialysis can improve some cognitive domains but may worsen perceived burden and kidney disease–related quality of life in elderly or highly comorbid patients, highlighting that patient-reported outcomes can diverge from survival metrics [^117BWQmz] [^113jGs1H] [^1121nrDN].

> I will now examine the major prognostic modifiers. Age is a dominant effect modifier; in older adults, the risk of death exceeds the risk of progression to ESRD at higher eGFR thresholds, and the eGFR level at which ESRD risk surpasses death risk decreases with younger age, underscoring competing mortality in the elderly with advanced CKD [^1117s4hu]. Comorbidity burden, especially cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease, erodes the survival advantage of dialysis, and frailty, functional impairment, and geriatric syndromes further worsen outcomes and may shift the balance toward conservative care in shared decision-making [^116VhX4N] [^111dLaXE]. I need to ensure I also account for albuminuria, diabetes, anemia, and rate of eGFR decline, all of which correlate with faster progression and worse survival and should be integrated into individualized risk discussions [^117RWyHq] [^112oZPsb].

> Let me think about how to operationalize prognosis in practice. I should confirm which tools are validated for advanced CKD. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation provides 2- and 5-year probabilities of kidney failure and is recommended by KDIGO 2024 for stages 3–5, while risk equations developed for earlier CKD stages should not be extrapolated to stage 5, and competing-risk–aware approaches are preferable when discussing mortality alongside kidney failure risk to avoid overestimating dialysis benefit [^113i5xR6] [^115sgwo7] [^114LxaNs] [^111ACPS1]. But wait, what about geriatric-specific mortality tools? The REIN and Bansal scores can help estimate mortality risk in older adults with advanced CKD, and functional assessments should be incorporated to identify patients who may benefit more from comprehensive conservative care than from dialysis [^1115Tb3W] [^113QmwQn] [^115oQYYd].

> Next, I should review guideline thresholds that trigger action. KDIGO 2024 suggests using a 5-year kidney failure risk of 3–5% to consider nephrology referral, a 2-year risk above 10% to prompt multidisciplinary care, and a 2-year risk above 40% to initiate modality education and preparation for kidney replacement therapy, including vascular access planning, while emphasizing that these thresholds be integrated with clinical judgment and patient preferences rather than used rigidly [^1124xu67] [^116PeK6h] [^114cduQC]. Hold on, I should verify that these thresholds are intended as aids, not mandates; yes, KDIGO frames them as practice points to support shared decision-making rather than prescriptive rules [^111ACPS1].

> I need to ensure the communication strategy aligns with patient values. Many older patients prioritize quality of life, symptom control, and preparation over survival alone, and they may conflate ESRD risk with imminent death, so I should explicitly separate these risks and present trajectories for dialysis, conservative management, and transplant where relevant, using plain language and visual aids to reduce decisional conflict and regret [^116dUbA2] [^112n5Zkj]. Let me reconsider whether hope and uncertainty are acceptable; qualitative data suggest patients can leverage prognostic uncertainty to maintain hope while still planning, which supports transparent, iterative conversations about goals and trade-offs [^116dUbA2].

> Finally, I should double-check the practical decision framework. For patients under 65 with low comorbidity, dialysis generally confers a substantial survival advantage and is reasonable to prioritize if aligned with preferences, whereas for patients over 75–80 or those with high comorbidity, the survival difference is small or absent and conservative management may offer better quality of life and less treatment burden, warranting a conservative-first discussion with the option to revisit if clinical trajectories change [^116CL7kp] [^11399TQL] [^1121nrDN]. I need to ensure we avoid defaulting to dialysis solely based on eGFR and instead integrate symptoms, functional status, frailty, and patient goals, recognizing that conservative kidney management is a planned, active care pathway rather than "doing nothing" [^1178HTZ2] [^1121nrDN].

Stage 5 CKD carries a **poor prognosis**, with median survival of 21–67 months depending on treatment choice and comorbidity burden [^116CL7kp]. Dialysis extends survival compared with conservative care, but the benefit diminishes with age and comorbidities; in patients over 75 with high comorbidity, the survival advantage is minimal (about 4–5 months) and not statistically significant [^116VhX4N] [^111S88yf]. Cardiovascular disease is the **leading cause of death**, accounting for 40–50% of deaths, and the 1-year mortality is 20–25% [^notfound]. Prognosis is strongly influenced by age, comorbidities, nutritional status, and dialysis initiation timing; early, planned nephrology care and patient-centered decision-making improve outcomes and quality of life [^1178HTZ2] [^1121nrDN].

---

## Survival and mortality

- **Median survival**: Median survival from entry into stage 5 CKD is approximately 21.2 months with conservative management and 67.1 months with renal replacement therapy (RRT) [^116CL7kp].

- **Dialysis benefit**: Dialysis confers a survival advantage over conservative management, but this benefit diminishes with advancing age and comorbidity burden [^11399TQL].

- **Elderly patients**: In patients aged > 75 years with high comorbidity, the survival advantage of dialysis over conservative management is minimal (approximately 4–5 months) and not statistically significant [^111S88yf].

- **One-year mortality**: One-year mortality rates are approximately 20–25% for stage 5 CKD patients, regardless of dialysis initiation [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis** in stage 5 CKD:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older age is associated with increased mortality and diminished benefit from dialysis [^1117s4hu] |
| Comorbidities | - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - And frailty significantly worsen prognosis [^112U7pQ8] |
| Nutritional status | Malnutrition and low albumin levels are associated with increased mortality [^notfound] |
| Dialysis initiation timing | Early, planned dialysis initiation may improve outcomes compared to emergency starts [^notfound] |
| Patient preferences and care model | Conservative kidney management can provide comparable or improved quality of life, particularly in elderly or comorbid patients [^1121nrDN] |

---

## Quality of life and symptom burden

Patients with stage 5 CKD experience **significant symptom burden**, including fatigue, pruritus, sleep disturbances, and psychological distress. Dialysis can alleviate some uremic symptoms but may also introduce new burdens, such as treatment-related fatigue, vascular access complications, and frequent hospitalizations. Conservative kidney management focuses on symptom control, quality of life, and patient preferences, often resulting in comparable or improved quality of life compared to dialysis, particularly in elderly or comorbid patients [^117BWQmz].

---

## Cardiovascular complications

Cardiovascular disease is the **leading cause of mortality** in stage 5 CKD, accounting for approximately 40–50% of deaths. The risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke, is significantly elevated due to traditional risk factors and CKD-specific factors such as anemia, calcium-phosphate disorders, and chronic inflammation [^112U7pQ8].

---

## Dialysis vs. conservative management

The choice between dialysis and conservative management should be individualized, considering patient preferences, comorbidities, and expected quality of life. Dialysis offers a survival advantage in younger patients with fewer comorbidities, whereas conservative management may be more appropriate for elderly patients or those with significant comorbidities, where the survival benefit of dialysis is limited [^11399TQL].

---

## Impact of early nephrology referral

Early referral to nephrology care (at least 6–12 months before dialysis initiation) allows for optimal preparation, including patient education, vascular access planning, and management of complications. Early referral is associated with improved outcomes, reduced emergency dialysis starts, and better quality of life [^1178HTZ2].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized care**, shared decision-making, and early preparation for kidney replacement therapy or conservative management. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend early referral to nephrology, patient education, and structured care plans to optimize outcomes [^1124xu67].

---

Stage 5 CKD has a **poor prognosis**, with median survival ranging from 21.2 months (conservative management) to 67.1 months (dialysis). Prognosis is influenced by age, comorbidities, nutritional status, and dialysis initiation timing. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality, and individualized care — including early nephrology referral and patient-centered decision-making — is essential to optimize outcomes and quality of life.

### Conceptual model of CKD: applications and implications [^111JNNmB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The conceptual model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was developed by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and subsequently revised and adopted by an international consensus under the auspices of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) in 2005. This model includes concepts of definition, staging, outcomes, and treatment, as well as risk factors for the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Treatments are available for patients with risk factors and for each stage of CKD; these include slowing the progression of kidney disease, preventing and treating the complications of decreased glomerular filtration rate, and reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors and treating cardiovascular disease. In principle, measures to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment could reduce adverse outcomes, improve the quality of life, and prolong the survival of individuals with CKD. The conceptual model for CKD is now being applied to a public health approach for the prevention of the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Primary prevention is defined as prevention of CKD; secondary and tertiary prevention are defined as improving outcomes of patients with CKD stages 1 to 4 and kidney failure (CKD stage 5), respectively. The conceptual model has also fostered debate about important questions: Is CKD a disease or a cardiovascular disease risk-factor condition? Do all patients with CKD need to be referred to a nephrologist? What does CKD care include? Should the classification be modified to include cause of disease and prognosis? Can CKD evolve from acute kidney disease, and is CKD reversible? Is albuminuria a manifestation of a kidney disease or systemic endothelial dysfunction? Is the age-related decrease in glomerular filtration rate normal or abnormal, and should we change the definition of CKD in the elderly? A combination of immediate action, data gathering, and research to establish the efficacy, effectiveness, and costs related to CKD are needed to respond to CKD as a public health problem.

### Dialysis or not? A comparative survival study of patients over 75 years with chronic kidney disease stage 5 [^116VhX4N]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The number of elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 is steadily increasing. Evidence is needed to inform decision-making for or against dialysis, especially in those patients with multiple comorbid conditions for whom dialysis may not increase survival. We therefore compared survival of elderly patients with CKD stage 5, managed either with dialysis or conservatively (without dialysis), after the management decision had been made, and explored which of several key variables were independently associated with survival.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of the survival of all over 75 years with CKD stage 5 attending dedicated multidisciplinary pre-dialysis care clinics (n = 129) was performed. Demographic and comorbidity data were collected on all patients. Survival was defined as the time from estimated GFR < 15 ml/min to either death or study endpoint.

Results

One- and two-year survival rates were 84% and 76% in the dialysis group (n = 52) and 68% and 47% in the conservative group (n = 77), respectively, with significantly different cumulative survival (log rank 13.6, P < 0.001). However, this survival advantage was lost in those patients with high comorbidity scores, especially when the comorbidity included ischaemic heart disease.

Conclusions

In CKD stage 5 patients over 75 years, who receive specialist nephrological care early, and who follow a planned management pathway, the survival advantage of dialysis is substantially reduced by comorbidity and ischaemic heart disease in particular. Comorbidity should be a major consideration when advising elderly patients for or against dialysis.

### The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO controversies conference report [^114cAf7s]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

### National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification [^111NhAoF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed ("spot") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists.

### Does conservative kidney management offer a quantity or quality of life benefit compared to dialysis? A systematic review [^11399TQL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) collaborate with their clinicians when choosing their future treatment modality. Most elderly patients with CKD5 may only have two treatment options: dialysis or conservative kidney management (CKM). The objective of this systematic review was to investigate whether CKM offers a quantity or quality of life benefit compared to dialysis for some patients with CKD5.

Methods

The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were systematically searched for studies comparing patients with CKD5 who had chosen or were treated with either CKM or dialysis. The primary outcomes were mortality and quality of life (QoL). Hospitalization, symptom burden, and place of death were secondary outcomes. For studies reporting hazard ratios, pooled values were calculated, and forest plots conducted.

Results

Twenty-five primary studies, all observational, were identified. All studies reported an increased mortality in patients treated with CKM (pooled hazard ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.34–0.65). For patients aged ≥ 80 years and for elderly individuals with comorbidities, results were ambiguous. In most studies, CKM seemed advantageous for QoL and secondary outcomes. Findings were limited by the heterogeneity of studies and biased outcomes favouring dialysis.

Conclusions

In general, patients with CKD5 who have chosen or are on CKM live for a shorter time than patients who have chosen or are on dialysis. In patients aged ≥ 80 years old, and in elderly individuals with comorbidities, the survival benefits of dialysis seem to be lost. Regarding QoL, symptom burden, hospitalization, and place of death, CKM may have advantages. Higher quality studies are needed to guide patients and clinicians in the decision-making process.

### Predicting the risks of kidney failure and death in adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease: multinational, longitudinal, population based, cohort study [^114LxaNs]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as the presence of abnormal concentrations of albuminuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for more than 90 days, affects 6–10% of the general population worldwide. Kidney failure is the most feared outcome of CKD; CKD disproportionally affects older individuals and most people with CKD are more likely to die than reach kidney failure. The five year risk of kidney failure is less than 1% in adults with mild CKD (stage G3a, eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m²), which is the largest fraction of the CKD population. People with moderate (stage G3b, eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²) or severe disease (stage G4, eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m²) have a higher risk of kidney failure and also a higher risk of death than people with mild CKD. Accurate assessment of both of these risks is key to inform treatment decisions in this patient population.

Although CKD guidelines advocate for shared decision making centred around the patient, existing tools focus on assessing the risk of kidney failure to enable timely preparation for its management. Nephrology referral is recommended when the predicted five year risk of kidney failure is more than 5%. Referral to enhanced multidisciplinary care is advised when the predicted two year risk of kidney failure exceeds 10%. Adoption of this strategy has shown potential to transform how kidney care is organised, and the patient and provider experience. However, the most widely used prediction tool for individuals with CKD only provides predictions for the risk of kidney failure in isolation, which is half of the story. Failure to simultaneously assess the risk of both kidney failure and death may lead to unintended consequences for people with CKD. If mortality is not considered, the prognostic information discussed in shared decision making may result in unnecessary referral and futile treatments, missed treatment opportunities, a failure to consider prevention or preparation for non-kidney health outcomes, or choices that do not reflect personal preferences, goals, and values. Besides lacking information on mortality, the current benchmark tool, kidney failure risk equation, in its original or recalibrated version, does not account for competing risks and hence may provide biased risk predictions for kidney failure.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of older patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR [^1115Tb3W]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (prognostic scores), ACP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the REIN score to predict the risk for mortality in older patients with CKD stage 5.

### In chronic kidney disease staging the use of the chronicity criterion affects prognosis and the rate of progression [^117Lm3rx]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative definition and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been adopted by most nephrologists but include a criterion of chronicity that has not been investigated. This criterion specifies that renal structural damage and/or reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be present for periods lasting longer than 3 months. We examined the effects of changing this criterion to 6, 9, or 12 months on the prognosis and the rate of progression in population-based cohorts with CKD stages 3 and 4. A 12-month chronicity criterion significantly reduced the number of CKD patients relative to the 3-month criterion for both stages 3 and 4. For both stages, there were statistically significant differences in 5-year mortality between the 6- and 9-month cohorts. For stage 4, the 5-year cumulative incidence of renal failure significantly increased from 6 to 9 months, and the rate of change in GFR significantly decreased between the same two cohorts. The 5-year cumulative incidence of improvement in GFR lasting 1 year or more was significantly higher for the 3-month cohort than for the 12-month cohort in the stage 3 group. Hence, we suggest that the chronicity criterion is an important determinant of the characteristics of the population of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. This may have practical consequences in both research and clinical work.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of older patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR [^113QmwQn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (prognostic scores), ACP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the Bansal score to predict individual 5-year risk of death before ESRD in non-frail older patients with CKD stage 3–5.

### Tough choices: dialysis, palliative care, or a third option for elderly ESRD [^116WQR9b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Dialysis should not be presumed to be the treatment of choice for all elderly chronic kidney disease stage 5 patients. Nondialysis active medical management, as an alternative to dialysis or palliative care, is a reasonable alternative in select cases. Early referral of CKD 5 elderly patients may lead to early initiation of dialysis, which may not be advantageous; it also provides an opportunity to institute active management as a treatment alternative. The informed decision to proceed with dialysis must involve both an assessment of evidence-based outcomes applicable to the patient, and allowance of patient preference. Prognostic tools are increasingly sought to aid in decision-making for elderly CKD 5 patients. Chronological age alone is not a sufficient predictor of benefit from dialysis treatments, according to observational studies and limited clinical trial data. The survival advantage of dialysis appears to be lost in patients with high levels of comorbidity. Establishing patient preference is an imperfect process, and many patients appear to regret their decision to undergo dialysis. With active medical management, efforts shift from prolonging life to emphasis on symptom control, dietary and medical treatment, and quality of life. Patient survival time can be remarkably long.

### Staging of chronic kidney disease: time for a course correction [^112UiF2D]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased in part because of the definitions and treatment guidelines set out by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI); however, the staging system set forth by these guidelines has led to several problems and unforeseen consequences. Stages 1 and 2 CKD are difficult to determine using the standard Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimation of GFR, and their clinical significance in the absence of other risk factors is unclear. Just because microalbuminuria in people without diabetes is a cardiovascular risk factor does not make it kidney disease. Most patients who receive a diagnosis of stage 3 CKD (GFR between 30 and 59 ml/min) are elderly people, and the vast majority of these patients will die before they reach ESRD. The staging system needs to be modified to reflect the severity and complications of CKD. It is suggested that stages 1 and 2 be eliminated and stages 3, 4, and 5, be simply termed moderate impairment, severe impairment, and kidney failure, respectively. In addition, age should be a modifying factor, especially in moderate kidney impairment. These changes would allow identification and treatment of clinically relevant disease and avoidance of what can seem exaggerated prevalence estimates.

### Unbiased kidney-centric molecular categorization of chronic kidney disease as a step towards precision medicine [^116KDRbi]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden affecting more than 850 million people worldwide, with a high cost of care and an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality. Biologically, CKD is a highly heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by sustained alterations in kidney structure and function arising from a wide range of etiologies and associated with a multitude of underlying molecular processes in the kidney. Even within the same diagnostic group, individual disease presentation, histopathologic features, progression rates, and treatment responses are variable, reflecting the underlying biological heterogeneity.

According to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines, CKD is classified into 5 stages (CKD 1–5), based on gradations of glomerular filtration rate estimated (eGFR) from serum creatinine level and degree of albuminuria. This classification system, now widely accepted, was a major achievement in the field, as it provided a common vocabulary and standardized approach for disease management. – However, the classification relies on systemic, indirect measures and therefore is agnostic to the local kidney pathophysiology. As a result, biologically diverse cases presenting with the same GFR or albuminuria values are classified under the same CKD-stage category, thereby precluding personalized prognosis and treatment options. Thus, a novel molecular dimension to use to categorize CKD is needed urgently, to fuel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic development toward precision medicine. –

### Illness trajectories and their relevance to the care of adults with kidney disease [^113Ag6bD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Existing practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease advocate a stage-based approach to management, in which treatment recommendations are based largely on the severity of kidney disease, and future risk for adverse health outcomes. However, the course of kidney disease can vary widely among patients with similar levels of kidney function, and each patient will experience their illness in unique ways.

Recent Findings

We summarize recent studies of patterns of kidney function over time among patients with chronic kidney disease, and discuss these findings in the context of relevant conceptual models of illness and communication. Although knowledge of disease severity can provide useful information on life expectancy and risk for future health events, an understanding of each patient's illness trajectory and their unique experience of illness is essential in supporting patient-centered care for patients with kidney disease. This information can be helpful in setting realistic expectations for the future, in communicating about prognosis and in aligning treatment decisions with each patient's goals and preferences.

Summary

We here explain how an understanding of illness trajectories may be useful in predicting and guiding care and decision-making in patients with kidney disease. We highlight the importance of competing disease trajectories, the heterogeneity in renal function trajectories among patients with kidney disease, and the variability in these trajectories over time in individual patients. We discuss how individual disease trajectories can shape each patient's experience of illness. Finally, we explain how an understanding of an individual patient's illness trajectory and experience of illness may be useful in guiding discussions about prognosis and treatment decisions and in supporting a patient-centered approach to care.

### Long-term mortality and risk factors for development of end-stage renal disease in critically ill patients with and without chronic kidney disease [^112Nxonu]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

As the demographic of the intensive care unit (ICU) population changes, more patients present with pre-existing renal dysfunction. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) as an abnormality of kidney function or structure present for more than 3 months, and is classified according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria to stages 1–5. Patients in stage 5 who have a loss of renal function (GFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²) requiring dialysis are referred to as having end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CKD and ESRD are associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, cardiovascular disease and death compared with individuals without renal dysfunction, and these diagnoses may affect outcomes following ICU admission. How the risk of death for patients with CKD and ESRD differs from those with de novo acute kidney injury (AKI), and what impact acute-on-chronic disease (AoC) may have, has not been fully investigated in ICU populations. A number of studies have addressed mortality in hospitalised and community-based populations with renal dysfunction; however, outcomes may not be generalisable to the ICU where the panorama of diseases and illness severity precipitating admission differ. Studies of ICU patients often lack comparison ICU cohorts and few have described long-term follow-up. Evidence suggests that illness severity scoring systems may overestimate mortality risk in ICU patients with pre-existing renal impairment. This may lead to overly negative prognostication and restrictive treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that ICU outcomes for patients with ESRD may be better than previously assumed and superior to survival in patients with AKI.

### Older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and their perspectives on prognostic information: a qualitative study [^116dUbA2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostic information is key to shared decision-making, particularly in life-limiting illness like advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

To understand the prognostic information preferences expressed by older patients with CKD.

Design and Participants

Qualitative study of 28 consecutively enrolled patients over 65 years of age with non-dialysis dependent CKD stages 3b-5, receiving care in a multi-disciplinary CKD clinic.

Approach

Semi-structured telephone or in-person interviews to explore patients' preference for and perceived value of individualized prognostic information. Interviews were analyzed using inductive content analysis.

Key Results

We completed interviews with 28 patients (77.7 ± SD 6.8 years, 69% men). Patients varied in their preference for prognostic information and more were interested in their risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than in life expectancy. Many conflated ESKD risk with risk of death, perceiving a binary choice between dialysis and quick decline and death. Patients expressed that prognostic information would allow them to plan, take care of important business, and think about their treatment options. Patients were accepting of prognostic uncertainty and imagined leveraging it to nurture hope or motivate them to better manage risk factors. They endorsed the desire to receive prognosis of life expectancy even though it may be hard to accept or difficult to talk about but worried it could create helplessness for other patients in their situation.

Conclusion

Most, but not all, patients were interested in prognostic information and could see its value in motivating behavior change and allowing planning. Some patients expressed concern that information on life expectancy might cause depression and hopelessness. Therefore, prognostic information is most appropriate as part of a clinical conversation that fosters shared decision-making and helps patients consider treatment risks, benefits, and burdens in context of their lives.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

Epidemiology and prognosis

The definition and classification of CKD was introduced by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative in 2002, and the international guideline group Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes in 2004. Kidney damage refers to kidney abnormalities observed during clinical evaluation indicating a reduction in kidney function. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities in kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that have been present for > 3 months and have an impact on health. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g (Figure 3). Because there is an increasing evidence indicating a continuous relationship between albuminuria and cardiorenal risk in the renal and nonrenal population, albuminuria is considered a prognostic marker for cardiovascular or renal risk, or both. Higher levels of albuminuria indicate a graded increase in risk for mortality independent of eGFR.

CKD is increasingly recognized as a global public health problemimposing huge medical and financial burdens on societies and health care systems with an estimated prevalence of 13.4% globally. The worldwide rise in the prevalence of CKD is accompanied by an increase in patients reaching CKD stage 5 requiring kidney replacement therapy. Currently, about 3 million patients are receiving kidney replacement therapy for CKD stage 5D worldwide out of 10 million who would qualify for kidney replacement therapy; these numbers are expected to grow by 50% to 100% until 2030, (Figure 4). Reasons for the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD, among others, include aging populations, increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and a low detection rate and therapeutic inertia in the early stages of CKD.

In addition to the KDIGO heatmap, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a validated tool used by clinicians in over 30 countries and recommended by the 2024 KDIGO guideline to provide a 2- and 5-year-probability of kidney failure in individuals with advanced CKD (G stages 3–5) by using the individual's UACR, eGFR, sex, and age. Physicians should be aware of this tool as it has demonstrated excellent discrimination in individuals with advanced CKD who are likely to progress to kidney failure at the 2- and 5-year time points and across CKD etiologies (link:

### Factors associated with kidney disease progression and mortality in a referred CKD population [^113W8ayq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Knowing how kidney disease progresses is important for decision making in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for designing clinical services.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We examined renal function trajectories in CRISIS (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Standards Implementation Study), in which 1,325 patients with CKD stages 3–5 and mean age of 65.1 years were followed up prospectively for a median of 26 months after referral to a regional nephrology center in the United Kingdom. By protocol, estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined every 12 months.

Predictors

CKD stage defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 (stage 3a), 30–44 (3b), 15–29 (4), and < 15 (5) mL/min/1.73 m².

Outcomes

Onset of renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, the composite end point of RRT or death, or decreasing CKD stage.

Results

During a median follow-up of 26 months, 13% reached the end point of RRT (5.1 events/100 patient-years), 20% died (9.6 deaths/100 patient-years), and 33% reached the combined end point of RRT or death (14.7 events/100 patient-years). For stage 3a, baseline prevalence and annual probabilities of decreasing CKD stage, RRT, and death were 18.0%, 0.41, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively. Corresponding values for stage 3b were 32.5%, 0.22, < 0.01, and 0.06; for stage 4, 36.5%, 0.17, 0.03, and 0.10; and for stage 5, 13.2%, zero (by definition), 0.31, and 0.08, respectively. Markov model projections suggested a steady decrease for proportions with stages 3a, 3b, and 4; a steady increase for death and RRT; and a biphasic pattern for (non-RRT) stage 5, with a plateau in the first 2 years followed by a steady decrease.

Limitations

Single-center observational study.

Conclusion

This study suggests that death and RRT are the dominant outcomes in patients referred for management of CKD and that most patients spend comparatively little time in late stages without RRT.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^116CL7kp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease and severe extra-renal comorbidity have a poor prognosis on renal replacement therapy (RRT) and may opt to be managed conservatively (CM). Information on the survival of patients on this mode of therapy is limited.

Methods

We studied survival in a large cohort of CM patients in comparison to patients who received RRT.

Results

Over an 18-year period, we studied 844 patients, 689 (82%) of whom had been treated by RRT and 155 (18%) were CM. CM patients were older and a greater proportion had high comorbidity. Median survival from entry into stage 5 chronic kidney disease was less in CM than in RRT (21.2 vs 67.1 months: P < 0.001). However, in patients aged > 75 years when corrected for age, high comorbidity and diabetes, the survival advantage from RRT was ~ 4 months, which was not statistically significant. Increasing age, the presence of high comorbidity and the presence of diabetes were independent determinants of poorer survival in RRT patients. In CM patients, however, age > 75 years and female gender independently predicted better survival.

Conclusions

In patients aged > 75 years with high extra-renal comorbidity, the survival advantage conferred by RRT over CM is likely to be small. Age > 75 years and female gender predicted better survival in CM patients. The reasons for this are unclear.

### What is the impact of chronic kidney disease stage and cardiovascular disease on the annual cost of hospital care in moderate-to-severe kidney disease? [^112L8gKy]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease

Cardiovascular disease and vital status were determined for each patient at the end of each annual period and categorized into a mutually exclusive hierarchy (in descending order): i) vascular death during the current annual period; ii) non-vascular death during the current annual period; iii) a non-fatal major vascular event (MVE: defined as coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, any arterial revascularization procedure, or stroke) during the current annual period; iv) most recent non-fatal MVE in the preceding annual period; v) most recent non-fatal MVE occurred in the annual period before last; vi) most recent non-fatal MVE occurred more than two annual periods previously; vii) prior vascular disease at randomization but no MVE since; and, viii) no vascular disease at randomization and no subsequent MVE.

Chronic kidney disease staging

Renal status was determined at each follow-up visit using local measurements of serum/plasma creatinine, or, where relevant, current RRT modality. For each annual period, the mean of all recorded creatinine results in the period was used to calculate the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and categorize patients into the following mutually exclusive 'stages': CKD stage 1–3B (eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m²); CKD stage 4 (eGFR ≥ 15, < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²); CKD stage 5 not on RRT (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m²); maintenance dialysis initiated in the current annual period; maintenance dialysis initiated in a preceding annual period; kidney transplantation in the current annual period; or, functional kidney transplant from an earlier annual period. In the cases in which information was absent, the latest information on CKD stage was carried forward for up to two years (for 3% of annual periods).

### Effectiveness of a brief hope intervention for chronic kidney disease patients on the decisional conflict and quality of life: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111zZcum]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With the rising prevalence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) around the world, an increasing number of patients who have been diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney diseases (CKD) must decide whether to undergo renal replacement therapies (RRT). Anxiety, ambivalence, and decisional regret are common reactions when patients are faced with making a choice between undergoing a conservative treatment or initiating RRT. Regardless of the benefits in terms of economic costs, mortality risks, and quality of life (QoL) from initiating dialysis in stage 5 of CKD, many such patients opted for conservative management or palliative care.

In a large study, it was pointed out that early initiation of RRT should not be based on the estimation of glomerular filtration rate only (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²). Prognostic uncertainty and the subjective perception that their health could worsen after receiving RRT are factors affecting the decision that patients make. Some patients felt unprepared or uninformed about their treatment options because of a lack of robust CKD decision-support interventions to thoroughly discuss the conservative management of CKD. Others felt pressured to make a decision, and often felt decisional regret when their condition deteriorated. It is noteworthy that a sense of hopelessness was documented in patients with chronic kidney diseases. Therefore, standard pre-dialysis education, which involves providing information on the comparative risks of different forms of treatment, is insufficient to guide individual decisions that are affected by personal values and perceptions.

### Trajectory of quality of life for poor prognosis stage 5D chronic kidney disease with and without dialysis [^117BWQmz]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) has not always been shown to benefit end-stage renal failure patients who are elderly or have multiple comorbidities in terms of survival or symptom control. Conservative management may be a viable alternative offering comparable health-related quality of life.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study of 101 patients who reached an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 8–12 ml/min and were either ≥ 75 years old or had an age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥ 8. Patients were all initially on conservative management; 38 later commenced renal replacement therapy while the rest remained conservatively managed. The Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form was assessed at baseline and various scheduled time points over 24 months. The mixed model methodology was used to estimate the quality of life patterns and adjust for covariates.

Results

In the conservative management group, the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores were stable and showed no significantly different trajectories from the RRT group (both p > 0.05). Though RRT was associated with an improvement in the Cognitive Function Scale score, it was also associated with worse scores on the Effect of Kidney Disease and Burden of Kidney Disease Scale scores.

Conclusions

RRT does not improve health-related quality of life of end-stage kidney failure patients who are elderly or have a high comorbidity burden.

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^113Mxqfc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

For the vast majority of patients with ESRD, RRT provides a huge survival advantage. However, in those > 75 years of age, this advantage may be restricted to those without high comorbidity. We found that elderly patients with high comorbidity treated by dialysis had a median survival that was only 5 months longer from entry into stage 5 CKD than patients who had undergone conservative kidney management — a small proportion of whom outlived all those on RRT by a number of years (Figure 2). In fact, when corrected for age, gender and comorbidity (Table 3), patients aged > 75 years did not gain a significant survival advantage from RRT. This does not mean that dialysis will not be of benefit for all elderly patients with ESRD. Clearly an individualized approach is necessary. RRT is likely to be beneficial in many patients especially those with low comorbidity and in those with rapidly declining renal function. Conversely, CM may have a role in those patients with high comorbidity and slowly declining renal function.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114GRPqv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification — KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO 2012 states that KDIGO recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for evaluation and management, with primary recommendations to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. The commentary work group agreed with most KDIGO recommendations, particularly those regarding the definition and classification of CKD, but noted concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification. The foreword notes that the inherent imprecision of formulas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for CKD classification was often underappreciated, that stage 5 CKD came to be interpreted by some as "time for dialysis", and that albuminuria, not part of the 2002 classification scheme, was itself an independent predictor of important clinical outcomes and that a more precise degree of risk prediction became available.

RISK ASSESSMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CKD

A summary of the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline recommendation statements and practice points on the risk assessment of people with CKD is presented in Table 2.

Table 2:

Summary of recommendation statements and practice points relevant to risk assessment in people with CKD in the 2024 KDIGO Guideline and differences from the 2012 KDIGO Guideline.

Monitoring of CKD

Monitoring eGFR and albuminuria in both adults and children with CKD is important not only to update staging for prognosis but also to guide clinical decisions. Because the KDIGO CKD staging classification based on eGFR and albuminuria is based on future kidney failure risk, their recommendation is to monitor those at higher risk of progression more frequently (e.g. they suggest monitoring kidney function and albuminuria once annually to people with CKD G1A2, but thrice annually to people with CKD G1A3, and consider even increasing this depending on the underlying aetiology of CKD). While the recommendation makes sense, the challenge lies in its implementation. European healthcare systems, as in other parts of the world, are affected by a severe under-recognition of CKD. While creatinine is measured in healthcare for many indications (and in most European healthcare systems eGFR is automatically reported), albuminuria screening and monitoring is still the bottleneck. For example, in a North European evaluation of processes of CKD care, only about a third of patients with incident CKD stages 3–5 received albuminuria monitoring within the following 18 months. Strategies to improve monitoring rates could involve educational campaigns to primary care and general physicians as well as individuals at high risk of CKD. Indeed, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline helpfully provides a list of at-risk individuals (Table 3). Economic incentives have been successfully shown in the UK to improve monitoring rates. In settings with less access to laboratory services, utilisation of novel and accurate POCT tools could also be potentially useful.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

### Decline in 20-year mortality after myocardial infarction in patients with chronic kidney disease: evolution from the prethrombolysis to the percutaneous coronary intervention era [^112zpPMF]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here we measured temporal trends in treatment and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) depending on kidney function at presentation in 12,087 patients admitted for MI to a coronary care unit from 1985 to 2008. The patients were categorized into those with normal kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate over 90 ml/min per 1.73 m²), and those with CKD as defined by Kidney Foundation practice guidelines, with 8632 patients (71%) at CKD stages 2–5. Use of evidence-based care increased over time in all CKD stages. Mortality rates fell over the entire time period. When comparing data from 2000–2008 to that from 1985–1990, adjusted 30-day mortality fell both in patients with CKD stages 4–5 (adjusted odds 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.18–0.60) and in those without kidney impairment (adjusted odds 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.10–0.42). This mortality decrease was sustained during long-term follow-up. There was no significant interaction between kidney function and decade of admission. Overall, median survival was over 20, 15, 8, and 1.8 years for patients with normal kidney function, stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4–5 CKD, respectively. Thus, during the past 25 years, treatment of patients with a MI improved substantially with a concomitant decline in mortality. Although our findings were similar for all stages of kidney function, the prognosis remains poor for patients with stage 4–5 CKD.

### Evaluation of cardiovascular disease burden and therapeutic goal attainment in US adults with chronic kidney disease: an analysis of national health and nutritional examination survey data, 2001–2010 [^111BKy4Q]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The stratification of CKD into 5 stages according to the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or level of decline in eGFR was previously based on criteria developed in 2002 by the NKF and subsequently endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Foundation. However, refinements to the CKD classification system were proposed to provide a more comprehensive description of CKD severity, disease prognosis, and CV risk. For example, the high prevalence of Stage 3 CKD, and potential differences in CV risk profiles within this stage, led some experts to suggest subdividing this category into Stage 3a and 3b CKD (eGFR 45–59 and 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2). This analysis of 2001–2010 NHANES data found that the prevalence of CV-related comorbidities and CV risk factors was significantly higher in Stage 3b versus 3a CKD, including an observed ~2-fold increase in the prevalence of CVD and stroke between Stage 3a and 3b, thus supporting this particular revision of the CKD classification system. Indeed, the recently released KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease now includes the subdivision of Stage 3 CKD, as well as the addition of albuminuria stages and diagnosis of CKD by cause, to enable more precise estimations of disease risk and prognosis in patients with CKD.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^115ZgkCw]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions and perspectives

Patients with CKD G4+ represent a high-risk population that requires specialized care and expertise that should ideally be coordinated by nephrologists. Despite their severely reduced level of GFR, the prognosis of patients with CKD G4+ is variable, with a substantial proportion of up to more than 50% surviving CVD event- and KRT-free for at least several years. The newly developed risk prediction tool specific for CKD G4+ may help to establish a comprehensive quantitative analysis of possible adverse outcomes, including CVD events, kidney failure and mortality, and thereby guide therapy. Such prognostic information can be factored into decisions for surveillance, CVD risk reduction, and eventual preparation for KRT. Another important finding of the meta-analysis is that traditional CVD risk factors appear to be relevant in CKD G4+, like in earlier stages of CKD and in the absence of CKD. Although such associations do not prove the efficacy of risk factor targeting, it appears rational to apply such strategies as long as no opposing evidence is available. Finally, there was general agreement that the complex comorbidities of people with CKD G4+, particularly those with functional impairment, older age, and limited life expectancy, mandate a patient-centric approach with joint decision-making both in routine practice as well as during the design of trials to optimize management and outcomes.

### Prediction, progression, and outcomes of chronic kidney disease in older adults [^113DiUtZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a large and growing problem among aging populations. Although progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a costly and important clinical event with substantial morbidity, it appears less frequently in aging people compared with cardiovascular mortality. The measurement of kidney function and management of kidney disease in older individuals remain challenging, partly because the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying age-related decline in kidney function, the interactions between age and other risk factors in renal progression, and the associations of chronic kidney disease with other comorbidities in older people are understudied and poorly understood. The Association of Specialty Professors, the American Society of Nephrology, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases held a workshop, summarized in this article, to review what is known about chronic kidney disease, identify research gaps and resources available to address them, and identify priority areas for future research. Answers to emerging research questions will support the integration of geriatrics and nephrology and thus improve care for older patients at risk for chronic kidney disease.

### The prepare for kidney care study: prepare for renal dialysis versus responsive management in advanced chronic kidney disease [^112n5Zkj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining conservative care

Treatment of kidney failure without dialysis — conservative care — can be divided into three types: comprehensive conservative care, where treatment is chosen or medically advised; choice-restricted conservative care, where resource constraints limit access to KRT; and unrecognized Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). The first of these, comprehensive conservative care, is most relevant to this review and is defined as 'planned holistic patient-centred care for patients with stage 5 CKD and including a full range of treatment and support, but not dialysis'.

So, if comprehensive conservative care is patient-centred, we must consider what matters to patients approaching the end of their lives. In a European, seven-country, telephone survey of > 9000 people (median age 50 years, interquartile rage 40–62), most prioritized quality of life over survival (from 57% in Italy to 81% in Spain), including those with advanced illness. In this study, only 2–6% of patients in countries said that extending life was most important, and this did not vary according to the respondent's health status. More specifically, a systematic review of the literature by Parker et al. found that while survival does matter to those with advanced life-limiting illness, equally and sometimes more important are: improved quality of life; control of pain and other symptoms; family support; knowing what to expect and having time to prepare; knowing that — if their disease is not curable and is deteriorating — the professionals are comfortable talking about death and dying; and continuity and co-ordination of care.

To help patients make shared decisions as they approach kidney failure, it is therefore important to have data on a wide range of these outcomes — survival, quality of life and symptoms, and more — and tailor the information provided to the priorities of the individual. Comparing experiences on dialysis versus conservative care brings unique challenges, however, and these must be appreciated when providing information to patients. Studies tend to be small, retrospective and observational, with all the associated biases. Particular challenges are biased between the groups compared (where there are unmeasured factors that determine which treatment the patient receives, i.e. confounding by indication), and lead-time bias (where it is hard to identify when dialysis would have been started in patients on a conservative care pathway).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112uyb2e]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

End-stage kidney disease risk prediction models in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — We suggest the use of a validated, end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). Both versions of the KFRE (4-variable and 8-variable) have high discriminatory ability to differentiate between those who develop kidney failure from those who do not, and the KFRE was validated in a meta-analysis that included > 725,000 participants from over 31 different cohorts representing 30 countries. The CKD Prognosis Consortium has also developed models to predict the risk of > 40% decline in eGFR, development of advanced CKD, and progression to kidney failure. Use of a validated risk prediction equation may help providers counsel patients, guide care, and optimize resource utilization targeting those at higher risk for progression, specifically patients with stage G3 or higher CKD, and kidney failure risk prediction may also assist with identifying individuals who need more intensive management or who may benefit from multidisciplinary care. The evidence base includes studies that were of Low quality and primarily outside the U.S.; Major et al. in the United Kingdom noted that adoption of KFRE in primary care increased the overall referrals to nephrology for CKD care while reducing unnecessary referrals, and using VA data, Duggal and colleagues noted that current laboratory-based guidelines for nephrology referral identified patients who were, on average, at low risk for progression, most of whom were not referred. Despite prior evidence of utility, studies comparing different risk prediction equations on their impact on referral patterns, clinical quality metrics, and clinical outcomes are limited; further, most new models were compared to the KFRE without examining their impact on clinical practice (e.g., whether they can augment UACR testing or adopt evidence-based therapy), and to establish the superiority of one equation or model over another, additional studies are warranted. Findings from the patient focus group emphasized informing the patient about the risk of kidney disease progression, and such risk prediction tools can be easily implemented within electronic medical records and help facilitate appropriate use of resources.

B ackground. Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease and severe extra-renal comorbidity have a poor prognosis on renal replacement therapy (RRT) and may opt to be managed conservatively (CM). Information on the survival of patients on this mode of therapy is limited.

Methods. We studied survival in a large cohort of CM patients in comparison to patients who received RRT.

Results. Over an 18-year period, we studied 844 patients, 689 (82%) of whom had been treated by RRT and 155 (18%) were CM. CM patients were older and a greater proportion had high comorbidity. Median survival from entry into stage 5 chronic kidney disease was less in CM than in RRT (21.2 vs 67.1 months: P < 0.001). However, in patients aged > 75 years when corrected for age, high comorbidity and diabetes, the survival advantage from RRT was ~ 4 months, which was not statistically significant. Increasing age, the presence of high comorbidity and the presence of diabetes were independent determinants of poorer survival in RRT patients. In CM patients, however, age > 75 years and female gender independently predicted better survival.

Conclusions. In patients aged > 75 years with high extra-renal comorbidity, the survival advantage conferred by RRT over CM is likely to be small. Age > 75 years and female gender predicted better survival in CM patients. The reasons for this are unclear.

### Long-term outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease [^116WAVXS]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses a recent paper by Menon et al. that described the natural history of a cohort of nondiabetic patients with stage 2–4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who had been recruited from nephrology practices and screened for entry into the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) trial. Kidney failure was the most common outcome during long-term follow-up among these patients and there was a low competing risk of death, findings in contrast to observations in other cohorts of patients with CKD. Patients with lower glomerular filtration rate and greater proteinuria at baseline were at increased risk for both kidney failure and death, but kidney failure remained more likely than death in all glomerular filtration rate subgroups. These results emphasize the heterogeneity of the CKD population. Nephrologists should not rely on CKD staging alone to direct management of or risk-stratify patients with CKD, but should also consider the etiology and rate of progression of kidney disease, patient age and cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^1178HTZ2]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by persistent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or the presence of other signs of kidney damage, is classified based on GFR and albuminuria categories. The risk for adverse outcomes, including mortality and kidney failure, increases with decreasing GFR and increasing albuminuria. Individuals with a GFR below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (i.e. CKD G4 or G5) are at particularly high risk across all albuminuria categories (Figure 1). In addition, CKD-specific complications increase markedly at low levels of GFR, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Of particular relevance is heart failure (HF), one of the most common CVD conditions for patients with CKD G4 or higher.

Kidney replacement therapy (KRT; i.e. dialysis or transplantation) can mitigate the consequences of kidney failure and improve prognosis. However, there are large variations in incidence rates of KRT, and globally only approximately half of those with kidney failure receive KRT. Inequalities in access to KRT play an important role, but differences in practice patterns also exist. There is agreement that level of GFR alone should not be used as a trigger for KRT initiation, and that signs and symptoms associated with kidney failure should be considered. Nevertheless, defining the optimal time for KRT initiation remains a challenge. Importantly the first few months on dialysis have been identified as a very high-risk period, though it remains unknown to what extent adverse events are triggered by dialysis initiation. Referral to nephrology services shortly before dialysis initiation has been associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes as compared with earlier referral.

Thus, low GFR (< 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) corresponding to CKD G4 or G5 (excluding patients on KRT and referred to subsequently as "CKD G4+") reflects a critical state for patients. A better understanding of prognosis of patients with CKD G4+ may inform treatment strategies, including decision-making for initiation of KRT. Therefore, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) collaborated with the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) to initiate a global meta-analysis of cohort studies (population-based cohorts, referred CKD cohorts, and research cohorts). The primary aim was to determine the prognosis of patients with advanced CKD with respect to initiation of KRT, CVD events, mortality, and relative timing of these events, with a second aim to determine variability of patient prognosis according to cohort, demographic, or health characteristics.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^116L4doz]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (i.e. chronic kidney disease [CKD] G4+) are at increased risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (including heart failure), and death. However, little is known about the variability of outcomes and optimal therapeutic strategies, including initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a Controversies Conference with an international expert group in December 2016 to address this gap in knowledge. In collaboration with the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) a global meta-analysis of cohort studies (n = 264,515 individuals with CKD G4+) was conducted to better understand the timing of clinical outcomes in patients with CKD G4+ and risk factors for different outcomes. The results confirmed the prognostic value of traditional CVD risk factors in individuals with severely decreased GFR, although the risk estimates vary for kidney and CVD outcomes. A 2- and 4-year model of the probability and timing of kidney failure requiring KRT was also developed. The implications of these findings for patient management were discussed in the context of published evidence under 4 key themes: management of CKD G4+, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of heart failure, shared decision-making, and optimization of clinical trials in CKD G4+ patients. Participants concluded that variable prognosis of patients with advanced CKD mandates individualized, risk-based management, factoring in competing risks and patient preferences.

### Association of albuminuria and regression of chronic kidney disease in adults with newly diagnosed moderate to severe chronic kidney disease [^111qKKjV]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with global population aginghas raised concern over the potential increase in demand for health care services, including specialist nephrology care. Albuminuria level, a marker of kidney damage, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a marker of kidney function, are routinely used to assess the severity of CKD. Both eGFR and albuminuria have been informative in constructing risk-stratification strategies to tailor CKD management and guide appropriate resource allocation, including expedited referral of patients at higher risk of CKD progression.

While recent evidence suggests that CKD regression (ie, sustained improvement in eGFR) occurs as often as progression, the traditional framing of CKD as an unrelenting and progressive process persists. Viewing CKD trajectory as a 1-way path toward failure may lead to an overly pessimistic prognosis outlook for patients and health care practitioners, hindering opportunities to improve health, and result in suboptimal CKD management. Studies have found that patients are often referred to nephrology despite not meeting regional criteria, possibly reflecting the belief among primary care physicians that progressive disease is inevitable. Although eGFR alone may not reliably differentiate individuals whose CKD progresses from those in whom CKD remains stable or regresses, referral is usually triggered by reduced eGFR, even in the absence of albuminuria, while referral criteria for albuminuria vary across guidelines. Finally, discharge back to primary care following referral is uncommon, despite the uncertain benefit of long-term nephrology care for many patients. Determining whether the probability of regression varies by degree of albuminuria could offer guidance to optimize CKD management and allow for more comprehensive patient education regarding CKD prognosis.

We performed a population-based study of adults with incident moderate to severe CKD to evaluate the 5-year probabilities of CKD regression, CKD progression, and death across clinically relevant categories of albuminuria, considering the recommended referral threshold of albuminuria. We also studied the independent association between albuminuria and CKD regression accounting for several baseline characteristics.

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^113ETwVZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Twenty-five years ago, a landmark publication drew attention to the rationing of access to renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the UK. In 1981, only 26.7 new patients per million population (pmp) had been accepted into RRT programmes in the UK, in contrast to 42.3 pmp in France and > 60 pmp in the United States. Rationing was most striking in those aged ≥ 45 years. Following these revelations, there was a welcome liberalization of access to RRT, fuelling a dramatic increase in acceptance rates, mirroring those across the developed world. In the early years of the new millennium, the incidence rates in the UK, like those in Northern Europe, stabilized at ~ 110 pmp, though far below those in the United States currently at 361 pmp. As a result, RRT populations throughout the developed world have expanded rapidly, the fastest growth occurring in the elderly, many of whom are dependent, and frail.

The benefits of dialysis for elderly, dependent patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who often have multiple extra-renal comorbidities, have been questioned. The prospects for rehabilitation in such patents tend to be slim, and prognosis is often poor. Dialysis in such circumstances can pose huge additional burdens for patients and their carers. The practice of withholding dialysis in such circumstances has been common. In recent years, the concept of the conservative management programme has gained sway in an attempt to provide a comprehensive package of care to patients who have chosen to forego dialysis. Conservative management of ESRD involves a shift from efforts to prolong life to those which focus on care, quality of life and symptom control. Control of fluid and electrolyte balance, anaemia management by use of erythropoietin if need be, the provision of appropriate end-of-life care and ongoing support for the patient and family/carers are important aspects. The concept has been embodied as a switching focus from curing to caring, though the notion of cure in the context of ESRD may be stretching the point.

### Chronic kidney disease and the risk of end-stage renal disease versus death [^117FcXfM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In the United States, approximately one in three adults aged 65 years and older has chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. The majority of patients with CKD do not progress to advanced stages of CKD because death precedes the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD),–even among patients with stage 4 CKD. The risk of death as compared to the risk of progression to ESRD may be even higher in older patients with established CKD. To date, studies have not specifically examined the comparative event rates of kidney disease progression and death and determined cause-specific death in older adults with established CKD. Given the aging population, the increasing prevalence of CKD, and the association of CKD with mortality,–understanding the clinical course and outcomes of older patients with CKD is particularly important. For these reasons, we examined the rates of ESRD, cardiovascular death (CV death), and non-cardiovascular death (non-CV death) among older, community-dwelling adults with moderate CKD, and we determined the risk factors for progression from CKD to ESRD and to death within a competing mortality risk framework.

### Risk factor analysis for a rapid progression of chronic kidney disease [^111S5zFC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) places a growing burden on healthcare resources worldwide due to its association with progression to kidney failure, hospitalizations and premature death.
Contemporary data on identifying individuals in routine clinical care with new-onset CKD at high risk of rapid progression of the disease is needed to guide allocation of prophylactic interventions.

This study adds:

The present population-based study shows that after 3 years, 15% of individuals with incident CKD stage G3 experienced rapid progression, 0.3% developed kidney failure, 53% were hospitalized and 18% died.
Easily accessible markers in routine clinical care could help identify individuals at high 3-year risk of rapid CKD progression, which primarily increases with higher stage of albuminuria, and is generally higher in males than in females and in those with pre-existing diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Potential impact:

Mild to moderate CKD is associated with considerable morbidity in a community-based setting, emphasizing the need for optimized prophylactic interventions among these patients.
The use of easily accessible markers in routine clinical care to identify individuals who are at high risk of rapid progression of CKD may facilitate intensified interventions to prevent complications.

### CKD stage at nephrology referral and factors influencing the risks of ESRD and death [^115Yx1VX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3–5 are at increased risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or dying prior to the development of ESRD compared with patients with less severe CKD. The magnitude of these risks may vary by stage, which has important implications for therapy. Our objective was to apply a competing risk analysis in order to estimate these risks in a referred cohort of patients with CKD by stage at referral and identify risk factors associated with each outcome.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

3,273 patients with CKD stages 3–5 who were referred to the nephrology clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, prior to December 31, 2008, with follow-up data available prior to December 31,2008.

Predictors

CKD stage at time of referral; demographic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics.

Outcomes

ESRD, defined as the initiation of dialysis therapy or pre-emptive kidney transplantation, and death from any cause prior to ESRD.

Measurements

Baseline laboratory data.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 2.98 years, 459 patients (14%) developed ESRD and 540 (16%) died. Rates per 100 patient-years of ESRD versus death prior to ESRD for CKD stage 3A were 0.6 (95% CI, 0.1–1.0) versus 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2–3.1; P < 0.001); for CKD stage 3B, 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8–2.1) versus 4.4 (95% CI, 3.3–5.6; P < 0.001); for CKD stage 4, 7.7 (95% CI, 5.9–9.4) versus 8.0 (95% CI, 6.2–9.8; P = 0.6); and for CKD stage 5, 41.4 (95% CI, 34.4–48.4) versus 9.4 (95% CI, 5.2–13.4; P < 0.001). For those with CKD stage 4, we identified 12 variables associated with higher risk of ESRD and 7 variables associated with higher risk of death prior to ESRD.

Limitations

A cohort analyzed retrospectively.

Conclusions

ESRD and death prior to ESRD incidence was most similar in CKD stage 4. We identified variables easily assessed at the time of referral that could discriminate between these risks.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic options [^112U7pQ8]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Richard Bright, a British physician, was the first to report the association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with CKD exhibit a pronounced risk for cardiovascular events: 50% of all patients with CKD stage 4 to 5 have CVD, and cardiovascular mortality accounts for ≈40% to 50% of all deaths in patients with advanced CKD (stage 4) as well as end-stage kidney disease (stage 5), compared with 26% in controls with normal kidney function, (Figure 1). In addition to the high risk for fatal atherosclerosis-related complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke, cardiovascular death also results from heart failure (HF) and fatal arrhythmias, particularly in advanced CKD stages. In > 70 studies in nondialyzed subjects with CKD, correction for classical and even less classical cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, did not neutralize the impact of CKD on cardiovascular risk. This review summarizes the current knowledge of CVD in patients with CKD, clinical consequences, and treatment options of CVD in CKD (Figure 2). Given space limitations, we will not cover special situations such as extrarenal involvement in vasculitides or the association of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with vascular abnormalities such as intracranial, aortic, or coronary artery aneurysms as well as aortic dissection.

Figure 1.
Cardiovascular mortality in the general population and in patients with end-stage kidney disease. In 25- to 34-year-old patients with end-stage kidney disease, annual mortality is increased 500- to 1000-fold and corresponds to that of the ≈85-year-old general population. Adapted from Foley et al.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus (RRT), ERBP 2015 guidelines recommend to give priority to the patient's general status and preference in selecting RRT as there is an absence of evidence of the superiority of one modality over another in patients with diabetes and CKD stage 5.

### Management options for an older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease and dementia: grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115g7c6T]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

About 15% of adults in the United States-37 million persons-have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic kidney disease is divided into 5 groups, ranging from stage 1 to stage 5 CKD, whereas end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is defined as permanent kidney failure. The treatment options for ESKD are kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and conservative management. The options for KRT include hemodialysis (either in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant. Conservative management, a multidisciplinary model of care for patients with stage 5 CKD who want to avoid dialysis, is guided by patient values, preferences, and goals, with a focus on quality of life and symptom management. In 2015, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommended that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 be educated about options for both KRT and conservative management. In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that assessment for KRT or conservative management start at least 1 year before the need for therapy. It also recommended that in choosing a management approach, predicted quality of life, predicted life expectancy, patient preferences, and other patient factors be considered, because little difference in outcomes has been found among options. Here, 2 experts-a nephrologist and a general internist-palliative care physician-reflect on the care of a patient with advanced CKD and mild to moderate dementia. They discuss the management options for patients with advanced CKD, the pros and cons of each method, and how to help a patient choose among the options.

KDOQI — definitions and scope for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) specify that "Definitions of DKD by albuminuria and stage are shown in Table 6", and that "we included studies of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 5 regardless of whether kidney biopsies were performed", while "Studies of kidney transplant recipients were excluded". Terminology is clarified: "the term DKD refers to a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes", and "The term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes". Practice context notes that "Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes", although "there are no conclusive data that early intervention and treatment of microalbuminuria prevents CKD stage 5 or mortality in such patients".

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^113jv7vV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

There are a number of drawbacks in our study including its retrospective nature and the absence of detail on patient characteristics such as Karnofsky performance score and frailty. This obliges caution in the interpretation of our results. These drawbacks however, are somewhat offset by the size of the study, which is the largest currently available, and the length of follow-up. We also used a non-standard simplified comorbidity assessment derived from our previous work. Our main purpose in this was to identify a high-risk group using a score that reflected both the number and the severity of extra-renal comorbid conditions rather than just a count of affected organs. Assignment to the high comorbidity cluster was a powerful predictor of mortality in the dialysis group. We think, therefore, this approach was justified. It should also be noted that our selection criteria effectively excluded most patients who were referred late. Such patients represent > 25% of new starters on dialysis, and elderly, dependent patients are over-represented in this group. The lack of time to counsel and plan in this setting may mean that patients start on dialysis by default, perhaps inappropriately. This is an important issue that is not addressed by this study.

Whilst our results contribute to the information that can guide patients in making treatment decisions, an individualized approach to decision making is mandatory. Thus, an elderly patient with high comorbidity and slow decline of renal function is likely to benefit from conservative management; this may not be an appropriate recommendation for someone with no comorbidity or rapidly declining renal function. Survival figures can only provide generalized information, and each patient should be counselled individually on his or her chances of benefiting from dialysis. Patients are free to change their treatment decisions and these need to be respected when planning care.

Our study has contributed to our understanding of prognosis in patients treated by conservative management. It has also demonstrated a survival advantage for the elderly (> 75 years) and for women on this modality, though the reasons for this are unclear. Conservative kidney management is a valid treatment option in selected patients, and our aversion to rationing should not dissuade us from rational treatment decisions. There is a dearth of prospective work in this area. The little information we have on the quality of life of patients on this pathway is reassuring. For many reasons, we are unlikely to acquire information from randomized studies in this area. High-quality prospective observational studies of outcomes, including quality of life, are urgently required.

Conflict of interest statement. None declared.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113cWuMb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

NKF-KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — burden and costs note that chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 11% of the US population, and those affected are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney failure. Kidney failure represents about 1% of prevalent CKD, and the prevalence of kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation is projected to increase from 453,000 in 2003 to 651,000 in 2010. In Medicare, the CKD stage 5 population nearly doubled in the last 10 years and, together with the expanded CKD population, they account for 16.5% of Medicare expenditures, nearly double that of the Medicare diabetic population, which now approach 24% of Medicare expenditures. CKD is a worldwide public health problem affecting more than 50 million people, with more than 1 million receiving kidney replacement therapy, and some adverse outcomes of CKD can be prevented or delayed by preventive measures, early detection, and treatment. Existing NKF-KDOQI clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) presently offer strategies to manage hypertension, dyslipidemia, bone disease, anemia, nutrition, and CVD in patients with CKD.

### Age affects outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^1117s4hu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common among the elderly. However, little is known about how the clinical implications of CKD vary with age. We examined the age-specific incidence of death, treated end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among 209,622 US veterans with CKD stages 3 to 5 followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Patients aged 75 years or older at baseline comprised 47% of the overall cohort and accounted for 28% of the 9227 cases of ESRD that occurred during follow-up. Among patients of all ages, rates of both death and ESRD were inversely related to eGFR at baseline. However, among those with comparable levels of eGFR, older patients had higher rates of death and lower rates of ESRD than younger patients. Consequently, the level of eGFR below which the risk of ESRD exceeded the risk of death varied by age, ranging from 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² for 18 to 44 year old patients to 15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) for 65 to 84 year old patients. Among those 85 years or older, the risk of death always exceeded the risk of ESRD in this cohort. Among patients with eGFR levels < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at baseline, older patients were less likely than their younger counterparts to experience an annual decline in eGFR of > 3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). In conclusion, age is a major effect modifier among patients with an eGFR of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), challenging us to move beyond a uniform stage-based approach to managing CKD.

### Does conservative kidney management offer a quantity or quality of life benefit compared to dialysis? A systematic review [^113jGs1H]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we explored studies evaluating CKM as an alternative to dialysis for adult patients with CKD5 in relation to mortality, QoL, hospitalization, symptom burden, and place of death. Overall, patients with CKD5 on CKM have poorer survival compared to patients on dialysis. However, we observed that for patients aged 80 years and above, or elderly patients with severe comorbidities, the improved survival on dialysis over CKM appears to vanish. Despite some inconsistencies, the results suggest CKM has advantages compared to dialysis for the outcomes of QoL, hospitalization, symptom burden, and place of death. These findings should be addressed when discussing future treatment options with patients. More rigorously conducted studies are needed to establish a better base for such a decision-making process.

### Competing risk of death and end-stage renal disease in incident chronic kidney disease (stages 3 to 5): the EPIRAN community-based study [^112oZPsb]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects a growing number of people, epidemiologic data on incident CKD in the general population are scarce. Screening strategies to increase early CKD detection have been developed.

Methods

From a community-based sample of 4,409 individuals residing in a well-defined geographical area, we determined the number of patients having a first serum creatinine value ≥ 1.7 mg/dL and present for at least 3 months that allowed us to calculate an annual incidence rate of CKD (stages 3 to 5). CKD (stages 3 to 5) was defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. We also described the primary care, outcomes and risk factors associated with outcomes using competing risks analyses for these CKD patients.

Results

A total of 631 incident CKD patients (stages 3 to 5) were followed-up until the occurrence of death and dialysis initiation for more than 3 years. The annual incidence rate of CKD (stages 3 to 5) was estimated at 977.7 per million inhabitants. Analyses were performed on 514 patients with available medical data. During the study, 155 patients (30.2%) were referred to a nephrologist, 193 (37.5%) died and 58 (11.3%) reached end-stage renal disease and initiated dialysis. A total of 139 patients (27.6%) had a fast decline of their renal function, 92 (18.3%) a moderate decline and the 272 remaining patients had a physiological decline (21.1%) or a small improvement of their renal function (33.0%). Predictors of death found in both Cox and Fine-Gray multivariable regression models included age at diagnosis, anemia, active neoplasia and chronic heart failure, but not a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Age at diagnosis, anemia and a low GFR were independently associated with dialysis initiation in Cox model, but anemia was not found to be a risk factor for dialysis initiation in Fine-Gray model.

Conclusions

This large cohort study provided useful epidemiological data on incident CKD (stages 3 to 5) and stressed the need to improve the hands-on implementation of clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and the management of CKD in primary care.

When attempting implementation, two things should be kept in mind. First, validation and recalibration of risk scores is ideally necessary to better adapt to each country/region/setting's background risks. Thus, we encourage this type of research across European countries to ensure best predictive performance. However, as for choosing which eGFR equation to use, it makes sense to ensure some uniformity across Europe to facilitate epidemiological research, trials and public health planning. Second, risk equations are developed within a specific population (e.g. CKD stages 4–5) and for predicting a specific outcome (e.g. kidney replacement therapy; KRT). Applying these scores in other populations (e.g. CKD stages 1–2) or outcomes (e.g. referral to nephrologist care) should be avoided. Although an obvious statement, automatic reporting in health systems without consideration of this detail may provide incorrect risk estimates and prompt incorrect clinical decisions.

Risk scores are meant as an aid to support clinical decisions and patient discussions, but not as a substitute for clinical judgement. The 2024 KDIGO CKD Guideline provides a series of practice points suggesting KFRE thresholds to motivate decisions like referral to nephrologist or interprofessional care, or vascular access planning. Although well intended, these thresholds are suggestions that require validation. In a Swedish validation study, the utility of using KFRE > 40% and KFRE > 50% for vascular access planning was considerably higher compared with the more traditionally used eGFR threshold < 15 mL/min/1.73 m². More work along these lines may increase our confidence and experience in integrating risk scores in our European routine clinical practice. However, at present the evidence that the use of risk-based equations leads to better outcomes or patient experience is lacking and further studies into this are required. The 2024 KDIGO CKD Guideline ends this section encouraging us to use also cardiovascular disease risk prediction scores to help inform cardiovascular prognostication and further communication with cardiologists.

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^115GAGRB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

We reviewed the computerized records of all patients who had attended our nephrology clinics with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). We selected for further study all patients who had progressed as far as stage 5 CKD based on eGFR estimated by MDRD-4 equation. This was over an 18-year period to August 2008. To meet this criterion, each patient had:
At least one value of eGFR in the range 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m 2
All subsequent recorded values of eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2

We examined detailed computerized records and the case notes for all patients included in the study.

Survival in all patients was calculated from the date of the first recorded value in stage 5 CKD as outlined above. Patients who presented in advanced stage 5 CKD (eGFR < 10) were not included since the unavailability of the date at which they reached stage 5 CKD made it impossible to estimate survival time from entry to stage 5.

Patients were categorized into RRT patients or conservatively managed patients. Patients were designated as RRT patients if they:
Subsequently commenced on dialysis either haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) — OR
Subsequently underwent pre-emptive transplantation — OR
Had made a decision to commence dialysis and had begun preparations for this, often involving the creation of an A-V fistula, but had died before dialysis initiation.

Patients were designated as conservatively managed if they had made a decision to forego dialysis, should their kidney failure continue to progress.

Modality choice

We aimed to offer patients a free choice of modality constrained only by clinical and social imperatives. After the diagnosis of progressive CKD, patients were referred by the nephrologists to a liaison team, led by a senior nurse and a renal counsellor. This referral usually took place when the patient had stage 4 CKD — but for a minority of patients this was sometimes later. The role of the team included assessment, education, counselling and support of the patient and family/carer before, during and after modality choice. This process included a number of interviews with each patient and significant others and at least one visit to the patient's home. After subsequent discussions within the multidisciplinary team, treatment options were discussed with each patient and significant others and an individualized treatment plan formulated. Some patients with low comorbidity chose CM when the chances of survival could have been higher on RRT. They were specifically counselled on the potential benefits of RRT, but their final decision was respected.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to risk prediction, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using a 2-year kidney failure risk of > 10%, in conjunction with eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations, to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care.

### Benefit of primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in the setting of chronic kidney disease: a decision model analysis [^114e4jj3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary prevention ICD trials have excluded patients with CKD. Comorbidities and lower life expectancy in patients with CKD make the benefit of primary prevention ICD implantation uncertain.

Methods

A decision analysis model was devised to evaluate the risks and benefits of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) implantation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who meet current criteria for a primary prevention ICD. Published data capturing event rates, infection risks, and overall survival in CKD patients with and without ICDs were utilized. Variables included patient's age, GFR and stage of CKD, probability of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and device implantation mortality.

Results

The benefit of an ICD for primary prevention of SCD in patients with CKD depends primarily on the patient's age and stage of kidney disease. With stages 1 and 2 CKD, ICD implantation reduces mortality. However, in patients with more advanced stages of CKD, the benefit is less significant and age-dependent. This is attributed to patients with advanced CKD having a higher procedural risk and decreased life expectancy. With average procedural mortality, ICD implantation is favored at ages < 80 for stage 3, ages < 75 for stage 4, and ages < 65 for stage 5. As procedural mortality rates increase, age thresholds for ICD implantation decrease.

Conclusions

Our model shows that benefit from primary prevention ICD implantation is determined by the patient's age and stage of kidney disease. While there is limited impact with lower stages of CKD, careful consideration of ICD implantation is suggested for older patients with more advanced stages of kidney disease.

### Projecting the clinical burden of chronic kidney disease at the patient level (): a microsimulation modelling study [^115g3tD8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a debilitating condition that affects 10–15% of the global adult population.CKD is usually diagnosed using two critical observations, albuminuria (> 30 mg/g creatinine) and impaired kidney function, as defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. CKD is further classified by the level of albuminuria (stages A1–3), and the reduction of GFR (stages G3a–5). As kidney function declines with age, older patients may be vulnerable to developing CKD, with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertensionalso acting as risk factors. Once diagnosed, CKD progression is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure; these conditions may also accelerate the onset of kidney failure. In patients with CKD, comorbid conditions, complications, and major health events all contribute to a lower health-related quality of life, and a higher risk of premature death.

Given the current trajectory of risk factors, CKD is predicted to become an even more common cause of death by 2040 than it is nowwith low rates of diagnosis and a general lack of awareness exacerbating the implications of the condition. Despite a clear need for proactive disease management, there is a paucity of data regarding disease burden that limits optimisation of management strategies. Complementary to real-world data studies, microsimulations create virtual, heterogeneous populations through which clinical outcomes can be modelled. By using a broad range of real-world inputs (including hospital records and national statistics), the course of a disease and associated patient outcomes can be projected. A particular strength of microsimulation modelling is that the granularity of inputs enables the full complexity of a disease to be considered. Ideally, microsimulations should incorporate multiple inputs with a high level of granularity, and model interventions that can be explored in virtual scenarios.

Inside CKD uses a microsimulation methodology to quantify the projected global impact of CKD from 2022 to 2027. Here, we outline changes in the prevalence and distribution of disease stages and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) modalities, assessing the clinical burden for 31 countries/regions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia–Pacific/Middle East.

### Metabolic surgery reduces the risk of progression from chronic kidney disease to kidney failure [^113YeqRE]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC), 1 in 4 patients age ≥ 65 in North America has some form of chronic kidney disease (CKD), while 3 in 100 will progress to kidney failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether bariatric surgery alters the progression of CKD to kidney failure in patients who are severely obese.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent bariatric surgery at our institution over the last 16 years. Kidney function and injury were assessed using the average estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) over 3 months preoperatively and postoperative at 12-month follow-up. The risk of progression from CKD to kidney failure was assessed using the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) equation.

Results

Out of 2924 patients reviewed over this period of time, 69 (2.4%) had the recorded data necessary to assess kidney injury and the risk of disease progression to kidney failure. Patients within moderate and severe stages of CKD-related albuminuria improved the most at 12-month follow-up (by 48% and 79%; P = 0.0001 and P = 0.025, respectively). This translated to a relative risk reduction for progression to kidney failure in CKD ≥ stage 3 patients of 70% at 2 years and 60% at 5 years (both P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Bariatric surgery seems to improve kidney injury, especially among patients with the most severe stages of CKD. Marked 2- and 5-year risk reduction in the progression from CKD to kidney failure was observed.

### The development of anemia is associated to poor prognosis in NKF / KDOQI stage 3 chronic kidney disease [^113WvQqy]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent disease frequently associated with diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk. This combination results in a considerable mortality rate. The prevalence of CKD stages 3–5 is 6.8% in Spain. Anemia is common in CKD and has been linked to cardiovascular disease and mortality. According to THE European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) published in 2004, a diagnosis of anemia is considered to be a hemoglobin concentration (Hb) of less than 11.5 g/dL in women, < 12 g/dL in men aged > 70 years, or < 13.5 g/dL in men aged ≤ 70 years. Renal anemia in CKD is largely due to a deficiency in renal production of erythropoietin, usually being normocytic and normochromic, although its appearance has been also associated to iron deficiency, and several retrospective studies have reported a higher prevalence of anemia when inflammatory processes, malnutrition or diabetes are present in severe CKD.

The development of anemia is expected in CKD stages 3 to 5, but onset varies from one patient to another. A large cohort study performed between 1988 and 1994 reported a prevalence of renal anemia of 1% in CKD stage 3, 9% in stage 4 and over 33% in stage 5. Later studies reported higher values (5% for CKD-3 and 55% for CKD-4).

On the other hand, CKD-3 patients may be asymptomatic, especially in the absence of anemia or other complications. Many are not referred to nephrologists and, therefore, little is known of their characteristics and evolution. Moreover, most studies on the prevalence of anemia are cross-sectional and do not establish the onset and evolution of anemia. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the time course of the clinical evolution of stage 3 CKD patients, to estimate the incidence of anemia of renal origin and to describe its characteristics.

Outcomes — For the first key question, the critical outcome is point prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by risk factor and patient demographics/characteristics, and important outcomes include probability of decline in eGFR, incident/worsening of albuminuria, or kidney failure; incidence rates of CKD diagnosis; CKD stage at diagnosis; kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant); and CKD diagnosis rate at different predefined timepoints. For the second key question, critical outcomes are risk of CKD progression to ESKD and validated surrogate markers/predictors of CKD progression, and important outcomes are mortality and cardiovascular composite outcome (e.g. MACE).

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^111oPZ8g]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

It is important to distinguish this rational and appropriate use of therapies from the rationing approach referred to above. Rationing in this context refers to the limiting of access to expensive medical interventions in order to control the use of resources. A rational or appropriate approach refers to foregoing therapies in circumstances in which their use is likely to be futile or detrimental to patient well-being.

A number of studies have described the outcome of conservative kidney management. In the comparative studies, dialysis for elderly patients with high comorbidity did not confer a significant survival advantage over conservative management, at least in terms of hospital-free days. In all these studies, the numbers of patients treated by conservative kidney management were small and follow-up relatively short. We studied a large series of conservatively managed patients and compared survival to those of a contemporaneous group of RRT patients. We also studied the predictors of survival in both groups.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^1143HA3A]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Choosing patient-relevant interventions and outcomes

As for most medical disciplines, available trial evidence in CKD G4+ populations reflects the interests and priorities of clinicians and researchers rather than patients and families. Correcting this misalignment is critical for improving the utility of trial findings and potentially for facilitating trial conduct by increasing participant recruitment and retention. Existing processes for identifying patient-centered research priorities and patient-relevant outcomes (e.g. those identified using the James Lind Alliance methodology) will be helpful for achieving this aim. A list of such priorities for CKD G3a to G5 patients is already available, and could be used as the basis for people with CKD G4+ specifically. Initiation of KRT is clinically meaningful and, therefore, the obvious choice as an outcome in trials of therapies aimed at slowing the loss of kidney function. However, KRT initiation is determined by many factors such as local habits and guidelines, physicians' and patients' preferences, and patients' well-being and comorbidities. Functional and symptomatic outcomes that are patient-oriented, both before and after the initiation of KRT, are important to address for safety as well as efficacy, and are relevant for the patient. A toolbox that includes validated symptomatic assessment will support trials with functional outcomes.

Increasing and sustaining patient engagement in trials and other clinical research is critical, but no consensus was reached on how this goal should be achieved or approached. A key starting point could be to describe lessons learned from leading patient-centered initiatives (e.g. SONG-HDand NICE) and establish an organization responsible for patient engagement in CKD G4+ research specifically.

### Understanding the patient experience of chronic kidney disease stages 2–3b: a qualitative interview study with kidney disease quality of life (KDQOL-36) debrief [^112dpinZ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue affecting 840 million individuals worldwide and is expected to be the fifth leading cause of mortality by 2040. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² and/or urine albumin to creatinine ratio greater than 30 mg/g for more than 3 months are typically used in diagnosis and staging of CKD.

The severity and progression of CKD is divided into five stages (1–5) based on eGFR. At stage 1 there is evidence of kidney disease, but kidney function is still normal, and by stage 5 (end-stage kidney disease [ESKD]) kidney function is no longer sufficient to sustain essential body functions. Stage 3 is divided into 3a and 3b, indicating 'mildly to moderately decreased' and 'moderately to severely decreased' activity, respectively.

CKD is associated with several comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, anaemia, hyperuricaemia and gout, and cardiovascular diseases including heart failure. The combined effect of such conditions can cause increased morbidity and mortality. As patients' CKD progresses there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events, adverse kidney outcomes and death. It is also recognized that patients experience mental health conditions and symptoms, including fatigue and sleep disorders, as consequences of CKD. The combination of physical, mental and social impacts of CKD on patients can negatively affect their quality of life.

A comprehensive understanding of patient experience can improve dialogue between patients and clinicians, allowing more informed treatment decisions and, consequently, better patient care. Direct patient reporting can help identify previously unrecognized symptoms and highlight aspects of a disease or therapy that patients feel have the greatest impact on their lives.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of SHARP patients included in the cost analysis

Data are n (%), mean (SD) or median (IQR); CKD = chronic kidney disease.

1 9 patients who received a transplant prior to randomization were excluded from the tabulation by baseline CKD stage.

2 Predominantly CKD stage 3B (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 ml/min/1.73 m²).

3 Percentages exclude patients for whom data were not available.

Table 2
Number of patient years with events and use of renal replacement therapy by baseline CKD stage

Data are the number of annual periods in which the defined event occurs or the RRT status, and percentage of all annual periods. In each annual period, each participant on renal replacement therapy is classified into one of: (1) kidney transplantation in current annual period; (2) functioning kidney transplantation from an earlier annual period; (3) dialysis initiated during the current annual period; and (4) on dialysis since an earlier annual period.

CKD = chronic kidney disease.

1 9 patients who received a transplant prior to randomization were excluded from the tabulation by baseline CKD stage.

2 Predominantly CKD stage 3B (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 ml/min/1.73m 2).

A total of 21,157 hospital care episodes were recorded across the 7,246 study patients, an average of 0.77 episodes per patient per year (excluding routine dialysis sessions). These included 0.33 episodes per year for non-vascular/non-renal events, 0.32 episodes per year for renal events, and 0.06 episodes per year for each of atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic vascular events per patient. Worse kidney function at baseline was associated with increased rates of hospital episodes of all types. Non-vascular/non-renal episodes per patient-year ranged from 0.24 among those in CKD stages 1–3B to 0.45 in those on dialysis. Renal episodes (excluding routine dialysis) were lowest in those in CKD stages 1–3B (0.06 per patient per year [ppy]) and greatest in those with CKD stage 5 not on RRT (0.59 ppy). Hospital episodes for both atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic vascular disease per patient-year more than doubled from 0.02–0.03 ppy among those in CKD stages 1–3B to 0.08 ppy in those on dialysis at baseline (Additional file 1: Table S3).

### The weak correlation between serum vitamin levels and chronic kidney disease in hospitalized patients: a cross-sectional study [^117VWRvA]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to kidney damage and decreased renal function, which can be classified into 5 stages according to KDOQI guidelines. The global prevalence of CKD (stage 1–5) was estimated as 13.4% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 11.7 to 15.1%. The prevalence of stages 3 to stage 5 was 10.6% (95%CI: 9.2–12.2%). In China, about 119 million people are suffering from CKD. Individuals with CKD are facing an increased risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and mortality despite standard interventions for managing the conventional risk factors associated with it. CKD has been recognized as one of the most serious health problems worldwide, increasing the global burden of morbidity and mortality, as well as consuming scarce health resources. Therefore, deeper understanding of its mechanism and new intervention approaches based on non-traditional risk factors are of great importance.

Over the years, both basic research and clinical trials have improved our understanding of the interaction between disordered vitamins and CKD. CKD has been identified as a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency, which is highly prevalent in patients with CKD, especially those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and kidney transplant recipients. The deficiency of serum 25(OH)D3 (the major circulating form of vitamin D) is present in all subsequent stages of CKD, and the prevalence increases as kidney function declines. Individuals with 25(OH)D3 levels lower than 37.5 nM (15 ng/mL) had a higher risk for all-cause mortality despite adjustments for CKD stage and confounding factors. To date, no randomized clinical trial (RCT) aiming to verify the beneficial effect of 25(OH)D3 supplementation on the outcomes of CKD has been identified. The correlation between vitamin D and the prognosis of CKD needs further verification.

### Prevalence and incidence of chronic kidney disease stage 3–5-results from kidDiCo [^114v4zYZ]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global healthcare burden. As a major non-communicable disease, it is associated with adverse clinical and economical outcomes. However, awareness of CKD is low. Early detection is important to prevent and delay progression of CKD. CKD is associated with increased risk of death, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and high healthcare costs. The majority of CKD patients have diabetes (DM), hypertension (HT) and/or CVD, driven by a reciprocal relationship among these four major chronic diseases which complicates relevant treatment. CKD is classified by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) into 5 stages. Stages 1 and 2 require presence of kidney damage e.g. proteinuria. Stages 3–5 are defined by glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 over at least 3 months. Stages 3 and 4 (GFR 59–15 ml/min/1.73m 2) represent loss of 50% of normal kidney function and are seen as a cut-off for clinically significant CKD. CKD stage 3 is further divided into CKD stage 3a (59–45 ml/min/1.73m 2) and 3b (44–30 ml/min/1.73m 2). Stage 5 covers GFR under 15 ml/min/1.73m 2.

Albuminuria measurement for kidney disease and cardiovascular risk stratification is recommended by current guidelines. KDIGO guidelines divide the albumin/creatinine ratio into stages A1 to A3; albuminuria beneath 30 mg/g defined as normal (A1) to over 300 mg/g defined as severely increased (A3).

The crude prevalence of CKD in Europe spans from 3.3% in Norway to 17.3% in Northeast Germany. Reliable data on local CKD prevalence is, therefore, challenging to estimate.

CKD prevalence estimation is central to CKD management strategies, also for prevention of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and subsequent cost to healthcare systems.

The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence and incidence rate of CKD stage 3–5 in the Region of Southern Denmark, and explore the pattern of variation socioeconomically and demographically.

### A policy model of cardiovascular disease in moderate-to-advanced chronic kidney disease [^113Q91u9]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a long-term policy model of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in moderate-to-advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

A Markov model with transitions between CKD stages (3B, 4, 5, on dialysis, with kidney transplant) and cardiovascular events (major atherosclerotic events, haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death) was developed with individualised CKD and CVD risks estimated using the 5 years' follow-up data of the 9270 patients with moderate-to-severe CKD in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) and multivariate parametric survival analysis. The model was assessed in three further CKD cohorts and compared with currently used risk scores.

Results

Higher age, previous cardiovascular events and advanced CKD were the main contributors to increased individual disease risks. CKD and CVD risks predicted by the state-transition model corresponded well to risks observed in SHARP and external cohorts. The model's predictions of vascular risk and progression to end-stage renal disease were better than, or comparable to, those produced by other risk scores. As an illustration, at age 60–69 years, projected survival for SHARP participants in CKD stage 3B was 13.5 years (10.6 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) in men and 14.8 years (10.7 QALYs) in women. Corresponding projections for participants on dialysis were 7.5 (5.6 QALYs) and 7.8 years (5.4 QALYs). A non-fatal major atherosclerotic event reduced life expectancy by about 2 years in stage 3B and by 1year in dialysis.

Conclusions

The SHARP CKD-CVD model is a novel resource for evaluating health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of interventions in CKD.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: known knowns and known unknowns [^114YYuwL]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO controversies conference on supportive care in chronic kidney disease: developing a roadmap to improving quality care [^11148Aoa]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high burden of physical and psychosocial symptoms, poor outcomes, and high costs of care. Current paradigms of care for this highly vulnerable population are variable, prognostic and assessment tools are limited, and quality of care, particularly regarding conservative and palliative care, is suboptimal. The KDIGO Controversies Conference on Supportive Care in CKD reviewed the current state of knowledge in order to define a roadmap to guide clinical and research activities focused on improving the outcomes of people living with advanced CKD, including those on dialysis. An international group of multidisciplinary experts in CKD, palliative care, methodology, economics, and education identified the key issues related to palliative care in this population. The conference led to a working plan to address outstanding issues in this arena, and this executive summary serves as an output to guide future work, including the development of globally applicable guidelines.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^117U8Rd2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD — albuminuria/proteinuria change and clinical outcomes — secondary analyses from the RENAAL trial and IDNT have directly correlated albuminuria/proteinuria reduction with clinical benefit, yet in the opinion of the Work Group, there currently is insufficient evidence to assume that lowering albuminuria levels will necessarily lead to improvements in clinical outcomes such as progression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude a beneficial clinical effect on diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and to be considered efficacious, potential treatments for DKD must demonstrate benefits not only on albuminuria reduction but also on clinical end points such as CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^117NQxbs]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: Narrative rationale and guideline context for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — There are previous guidelines that suggest that 0.8 g/kg body weight/day among those with CKD stages 1–4 and also for CKD stage 5 (KDOQI 2007), and KDIGO guidelines recommended that 0.8 g/kg body weight/day be maintained and avoiding levels above 1.3 g/kg body weight/day (KDIGO 2012). In non-dialyzed DKD, evidence from controlled trials has been conflicting and a recent meta-analysis does show small beneficial impact of low protein diet on eGFR decline, however, the heterogeneity was really high. For DKD patients receiving dialysis, low dietary protein intake is associated with higher hospitalization rates and higher risk of mortality, the KDOQI guideline for dialysis patients suggests dietary protein intake of > 1.2 g/kg body weight/day, and Ko et al 2017 advised 0.8 g/kg body weight/day for DKD not on dialysis and > 1.2 g/kg body weight/day for DKD patients on dialysis.

### Factors influencing dialysis withdrawal: a scoping review [^115dmeAD]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of renal function over a period of months or years and is classified into five stages based on the measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). End stage renal disease (ESRD), or CKD stage 5, represents the most severe form of renal function, is characterized by an eGFR of < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and requires maintenance dialysis or renal transplantation. The prevalence of both CKD and dialysis is increasing globally, mainly because of long-term survival rates. There are nearly 700,000, 120,000 and 135,000 people with CKD stage 5 in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Europe, respectively. The prevalence of ESRD in Saudi Arabia ranges from 5.7%–6% and 6% in Australia. Furthermore, from 2006 to 2012 Canada had the third highest ESRD incident and prevalence rates after the US and Japan.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — definition and identification directives include: "Recognize that small fluctuations in GFR are common and are not necessarily indicative of progression. (Not Graded)". CKD progression is defined as "a drop in GFR category accompanied by a 25% or greater drop in eGFR from baseline", and "Rapid progression is defined as a sustained decline in eGFR of more than 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/yr". "The confidence in assessing progression is increased with increasing number of serum creatinine measurements and duration of follow-up". For people with CKD progression, "review current management, examine for reversible causes of progression, and consider referral to a specialist. (Not Graded)".

### Survival of elderly patients with stage 5 CKD: comparison of conservative management and renal replacement therapy [^111S88yf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Kaplan–Meier survival curves from entry into stage 5 CKD for patients treated by RRT (n = 689) and by conservative kidney management (n = 155).

Considering all patients aged > 75 years (Table 2 and Figure 2), those without high comorbidity had better survival when treated by RRT rather than by conservative means (36.8 vs 29.4 months: P = 0.03). However, patients in this age group with high comorbidity, treatment by RRT was associated with a smaller increase in median survival, of around 5 months, which was not statistically significant (Table 2 and Figure 2). Even within this elderly group, CM patients were significantly older than RRT patients (81.8 vs 79.3 years; P < 0.001). When all patients who reached stage 5 CKD aged > 75 years were analysed in a Cox proportional hazards model, after correction for age, diabetes, comorbidity, gender and ethnicity, RRT did not confer a significant survival advantage (Table 3 and Figure 3).

### The double challenge of resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^1168MVZZ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite adherence to a combination of at least three optimally dosed antihypertensive medications, one of which is a diuretic. Chronic kidney disease is the most frequent of several patient factors or comorbidities associated with resistant hypertension. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease, while chronic kidney disease is associated with an impaired prognosis in patients with resistant hypertension. Recommended low-salt diet and triple antihypertensive drug regimens that include a diuretic, should be complemented by the sequential addition of other antihypertensive drugs. New therapeutic innovations for resistant hypertension, such as renal denervation and carotid barostimulation, are under investigation especially in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. We discuss resistant hypertension in chronic kidney disease stages 3–5 (ie, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² and not on dialysis), in terms of worldwide epidemiology, outcomes, causes and pathophysiology, evidence-based treatment, and a call for action.

### Charlson comorbidity index and all-cause mortality in patients with delayed hemodialysis initiation: a prospective cohort study [^114D157y]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a public health issue. In 2017, the global estimate of CKD cases was 697.5 million (9.1% of the world's population), and the majority of cases were concentrated in low to middle-income countries. Patients with Stage 5 CKD represent the group of patients with the greatest disease burden and lower quality of life scores and are worse among patients receiving hemodialysis. Clinical practice should assess these needs and but not increase unnecessary burden. The presence of comorbidities and frailty at hemodialysis is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. This gives clinician-performed and patient-reported scales the value of being low burden interventions to assess patient prognosis. In patients receiving hemodialysis in particular, different scales such as the Index of Coexistent Diseases, the Wright-Khan score, the Davies indices, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), differ slightly. The differences were influenced mainly when albumin was adjusted, which could guide clinicians in combining clinical and biochemical characteristics to determine patient prognosis. The CCI in CKD patients has been shown to predict short and long-term outcomes such as unplanned readmission and mortality. Discussion of patient prognosis should be clear and reliable for clinicians before the initiation of hemodialysis. Therefore, we intend to evaluate the prognosis of patients with stage 5 CKD and late initiation of hemodialysis on the basis of their CCI stratification and after asking patients if they would be surprised if they died in the following 6 months.

### The case for early identification and intervention of chronic kidney disease: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^113Yd3VS]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes substantial global morbidity and increases cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Unlike other chronic diseases with established strategies for screening, there has been no consensus on whether health systems and governments should prioritize early identification and intervention for CKD. Guidelines on evaluating and managing early CKD are available but have not been universally adopted in the absence of incentives or quality measures for prioritizing CKD care. The burden of CKD falls disproportionately upon persons with lower socioeconomic status, who have a higher prevalence of CKD, limited access to treatment, and poorer outcomes. Therefore, identifying and treating CKD at the earliest stages is an equity imperative. In 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a controversies conference entitled "Early Identification and Intervention in CKD". Participants identified strategies for screening, risk stratification, and treatment for early CKD and the key health system and economic factors for implementing these processes. A consensus emerged that CKD screening coupled with risk stratification and treatment should be implemented immediately for high-risk persons and that this should ideally occur in primary or community care settings with tailoring to the local context.

### Analysis of specialty nephrology care among patients with chronic kidney disease and high risk of disease progression [^112rafNT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are patients with chronic kidney disease who are at high risk of kidney failure receiving nephrology care within 1 year of established risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 156 733 adult patients with chronic kidney disease, 58% of patients at high risk of progressing to kidney failure had a nephrology visit within 1 year of established risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that many patients with chronic kidney disease at high risk of kidney failure do not receive nephrology care within 1 year of established risk; better strategies are needed for identifying and referring high-risk patients.

### Personalised prediction of maintenance dialysis initiation in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3–5: a multicentre study using the machine learning approach [^113kDbzF]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we only focused on patients with CKD stages 3–5, and their risk of progression to ESRD is high. Hence, predicting the time of their dialysis commencement is very practical in our daily clinical care. Moreover, we carefully identified the model features associated with CKD progression and KRT based on the clinical setting and traditional logistic regression analysis. Forty-five significant prognostic factors were selected, including patient demographics, comorbidities, routine blood and urine tests and commonly used medications. Therefore, the predictive ability of our model has higher accuracy.

In further analysis of the ANN model, we also ranked all predictors according to their influence on the 1-year and 3-year models using SHAP values. Notably, several distinct features have been identified, respectively. For example, age, comorbidity (CCI score), PLT counts and WBC counts were important contributing factors in the 1-year prediction model, whereas gender and other medications such as proton pump inhibitors, beta-lactam antibacterial agents, organic nitrates and H2-receptor antagonists were relevant factors in the 3-year model. Common important factors identified in both models included eGFR at baseline, blood urea, serum creatinine and albuminuria (see figure 3). These are also key determinants for the risk classification of CKD according to the 2012 KDIGO guidelines. Other contributing factors in both models included serum Hgb level, TG or CHOL levels, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diuretic use, antihypertensive agents and medications for controlling blood glucose levels (see figure 3). Anaemia typically develops during the course of CKD; a decrease in serum Hgb is significantly associated with the progression of CKD. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of ESRD in adults. In patients with diabetic CKD, blood glucose levels are associated with poor outcomes such as serum creatinine doubling, ESRD and mortality, and intensive glycaemic control could reduce these risks. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that certain levels of dyslipidaemia is independently associated with rapid renal progression, KRT, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death in predialysis patients. Hypertension may occur early during the course of CKD and is related to a more rapid decline of kidney function, the development of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with CKD. Early intervention and tight control of blood pressure could lessen the risk of CVD and all-cause death in patients with and without CKD. Diuretics are an important part of guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with CKD with hypertension, oedema and hyperkalaemia. In terms of adverse effects, whether diuretics are an independent risk factor for CKD progression remains controversial. However, these medicines played important roles in both our models. Therefore, diuretics should be used with caution in patients with CKD stages 3–5. Finally, the GFR decline rate is also influenced by some immutable patient factors. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline has provided ample evidence that African-American race (not justified in this study), male gender and older age are related to a more rapid GFR reduction. In summary, our models take advantage of the important factors involved in the progression of CKD, are consistent with current clinical practice guidelines and are highly applicable. They could be a good screening tool to determine the likelihood of initiating long-term dialysis by using the available clinical data on the patient. Several limitations need to be addressed. First, due to the patient's lack of weight and height, the body surface area was not adjusted for eGFR. As a result, the determination of G-stage using unadjusted eGFR may be inaccurate for oversized patients. Second, using the decline in eGFR between baseline eGFR and previous eGFR may not accurately capture the progression of CKD when compared with the annual decline in eGFR during the follow-up period. Consequently, this factor did not significantly contribute to our model. Third, we only used retrospective data from three hospitals in Taipei to create our models, and it is widely recognised that racial and regional variables also influence CKD progression. Further work should involve training and validating the models through multinational and multiracial data before the clinical application is generalised. Fourth, we incorporated all important features into the prediction model, acknowledging that this approach might not be practical for clinical implementation. Nevertheless, these features underwent meticulous screening and hold varying degrees of significance in relation to CKD progression. Additionally, we assessed the model using only the top 10 important features and obtained comparable results (online supplemental tables S4 and S5, online supplemental figures S1 and S2).

### A health policy model of CKD: 1. model construction, assumptions, and validation of health consequences [^117GYmrR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A cost-effectiveness model that accurately represents disease progression, outcomes, and associated costs is necessary to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

We developed a microsimulation model of the incidence, progression, and treatment of CKD. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with survey and epidemiologic data sources.

Setting & Population

US patients.

Model, Perspective, & Timeframe

The model follows up disease progression in a cohort of simulated patients aged 30 until age 90 years or death. The model consists of 7 mutually exclusive states representing no CKD, 5 stages of CKD, and death. Progression through the stages is governed by a person's glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria status. Diabetes, hypertension, and other risk factors influence CKD and the development of CKD complications in the model. Costs are evaluated from the health care system perspective.

Intervention

Usual care, including incidental screening for persons with diabetes or hypertension.

Outcomes

Progression to CKD stages, complications, and mortality.

Results

The model provides reasonably accurate estimates of CKD prevalence by stage. The model predicts that 47.1% of 30-year-olds will develop CKD during their lifetime, with 1.7%, 6.9%, 27.3%, 6.9%, and 4.4% ending at stages 1–5, respectively. Approximately 11% of persons who reach stage 3 will eventually progress to stage 5. The model also predicts that 3.7% of persons will develop end-stage renal disease compared with an estimate of 3.0% based on current end-stage renal disease lifetime incidence.

Limitations

The model synthesizes data from multiple sources rather than a single source and relies on explicit assumptions about progression. The model does not include acute kidney failure.

Conclusion

The model is well validated and can be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CKD interventions. The model also can be updated as better data for CKD progression become available.

### Design and methodology of the aging nephropathy study (AGNES): a prospective cohort study of elderly patients with chronic kidney disease [^111dLaXE]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have initiated the recruitment of elderly patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 under treatment at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic. This study will bring novel data on risk factors in the context of CKD in individuals with comorbidities and geriatric syndromes, a scenario that raises many unanswered questions about when and to whom indicate RRT. This cohort will allow for the assessment of clinical factors that potentially impact the risk of death. Furthermore, this study aims to characterize the clinical and demographic profiles of elderly patients with CKD not receiving dialysis. Ultimately, this study will help elucidating if the risk of mortality will be higher than the risk of not starting dialysis in this population and the factors independently associated with each one of these outcomes.

This study includes several strengths such as a multidisciplinary approach that brings clinical information beyond nephrology since geriatric syndromes and nutritional status will be assessed. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study on Latin America with this profile.

Elderly patients with advanced CKD faces a high risk for common geriatric conditions such as cognition deficit. It is known that cognitive function broadly deteriorates as CKD progresses from stage 1 to stage 5. As CKD progresses, deficits in executive functioning, verbal fluency, logical memory, orientation, and concentration become more evident. People with end-stage kidney disease manifest significant cognitive deficits, along with delayed and immediate memory, visuospatial impairment, and overall cognitive impairment. Cognition, however, does not seem to increase the risk for CKD progression. In addition, it has been demonstrated that cognition declines faster in dialysis patients compared with CKD patients receiving conservative treatment, and in hemodialysis patients compared with peritoneal dialysis patients.

Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients with CKD. Recent evidence supports the prognostic significance of frailty for functional decline and poor health outcomes in patients with CKD. Frailty is also associated with bone loss among patients with CKD. Therefore, our study will add body to the literature showing if frailty will predict death or dialysis initiation in elderly patients with CKD.

### Outcomes among patients with advanced kidney disease who forgo maintenance dialysis… [^1121nrDN]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conservative kidney management is a planned, holistic, and person-centered approach to care for patients with stages 4 to 5 advanced chronic kidney disease who do not wish to pursue maintenance dialysis. 1 It includes "interventions to delay progression of kidney disease and minimize risk of adverse events or complications; shared. The median survival of cohorts ranged from 1 to 31 months in the UK, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 31, 34–36, 43, 50 6 to 37 months in continental Europe 13, 15, 18, 30, 34, 42–44, 50 had a median survival of 7 to 41 months, and cohorts 80 years or older 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19–21, 23, 25–27, 29–31, 35–40, 45–48 had a median survival of 1 to 37 months despite overlapping ranges of baseline mean eGFR. mean eGFR of 7 to 17 mL/min/1.

73 m2, whereas patients managed in a dedicated care pathway 11–14, 22, 25–27, 31, 35, 45, 50 had a median survival of 1 to 27 months and mean baseline eGFR of 10 to 19 mL/min/1.73 m². Studies measuring quality of life using the EuroQol-5D Scale reported small decrements 25, 34, 46 in overall quality of life during an 11- to 12-month time frame. Despite substantial heterogeneity across studies on the long-term outcomes of patients with advanced CKD who forgo maintenance dialysis, this systematic review found that patients could survive several years and experienced improvements in their mental well-being in addition to sustaining physical well-being and overall quality of life until late in their illness course. Nonetheless, use of acute care services was common and intensity of end-of-life care was highly variable across cohorts of patients.

Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to implement systematic and unified research methods for conservative kidney management and to develop models of care and the care infrastructure to advance practice and outcomes of conservative kidney management.
