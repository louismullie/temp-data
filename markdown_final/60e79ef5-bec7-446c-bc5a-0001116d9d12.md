## Question

How long should you treat community acquired pneumonia in pediatric patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia across outpatient and inpatient settings, considering factors such as age, severity, complications, and stewardship. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify disease severity and the clinical setting. Then, I should verify what contemporary randomized trials say about short versus long courses. Next, I will review high-quality meta-analyses and synthesize a practical, age-specific recommendation. After that, I should confirm what major guidelines advise and where they may lag behind current evidence. Finally, I will address special situations and provide a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored in the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Nonsevere outpatient CAP in children is the most common presentation, typically managed with oral amoxicillin and no supportive care beyond routine follow-up, whereas hospitalized CAP spans from ward-level disease to severe CAP with ICU-level support, and young infants under 3 months are a distinct group with different risks and pathogens. Complications such as empyema or parapneumonic effusion further modify duration decisions, so I need to ensure I'm mapping duration to severity and setting before recommending anything specific [^116c2RaS] [^113iffQj].

> Wait, let me verify the core question of duration for uncomplicated outpatient CAP. The SAFER randomized trial showed that 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin was noninferior to 10 days for previously healthy children aged 6 months to 10 years with CAP not requiring hospitalization, establishing 5 days as a valid standard in this group. I should also note the CAP-IT factorial trial found 3 days of amoxicillin was noninferior to 7 days for retreatment within 28 days, and SCOUT-CAP demonstrated superiority of a 5-day strategy over 10 days on a composite outcome balancing clinical response and antibiotic-related harms, reinforcing the short-course approach [^1119rqQt] [^115fvY6X] [^112YP5Wm].

> Hold on, I should double-check that these trial signals converge with higher-level evidence. A 2022 JAMA Pediatrics meta-analysis of nine RCTs including 11,143 children aged 2 to 59 months found shorter courses were noninferior to longer courses for treatment failure, with fewer reports of gastroenteritis and less caregiver absenteeism, supporting routine use of short courses; similarly, a 2023 Pediatrics meta-analysis of 16 outpatient RCTs concluded duration likely makes no important difference in patient-important outcomes and endorsed prioritizing shorter durations for nonsevere CAP treated with oral antibiotics, and a 2025 meta-analysis reported fewer serious adverse events with short-course therapy, strengthening the safety rationale [^116oborn] [^112bYRPQ] [^116oxAQZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a 3-day course might be universally sufficient based on CAP-IT, but I should be cautious not to overgeneralize. The CAP-IT noninferiority of 3 versus 7 days is compelling, yet its noninferiority margin and slightly longer cough duration warrant pragmatic caution in some contexts. SCOUT-CAP's explicit superiority signal for 5 versus 10 days and SAFER's robust noninferiority together suggest that 5 days is a balanced, guideline-ready target that maximizes both efficacy and stewardship gains, whereas 3 days can be reasonable in select, closely monitored cases with very early clinical response and good follow-up, but I would avoid defaulting to 3 days outside of research or highly controlled settings [^115fvY6X] [^112YP5Wm] [^1119rqQt].

> I need to check how this maps onto guidelines. IDSA/PIDS 2011 recommended 10 days as a baseline with consideration of shorter durations for mild disease, which at the time reflected limited pediatric data. However, given SAFER, CAP-IT, and SCOUT-CAP, contemporary practice has shifted toward 5 days as the default for uncomplicated outpatient CAP in children older than 6 months, with emerging support for even shorter courses in selected scenarios, and several health systems have operationalized 5-day amoxicillin as standard of care through pathways and order sets [^116c2RaS] [^1119rqQt] [^113Xbxfo].

> Let me consider hospitalized, non-ICU CAP. Evidence here is sparser than in outpatients, but a Johns Hopkins comparative effectiveness study of hospitalized children with uncomplicated CAP found no difference in 30-day treatment failure between 5–7 days and 8–14 days, supporting short-course therapy in clinically improving inpatients. I should confirm clinical stability before stopping and ensure safe step-down to oral therapy, as many children can complete a short total course once stable and afebrile for 48–72 hours with improving respiratory status [^115Fxepd] [^116c2RaS].

> I should confirm guidance for severe CAP or ICU-level care. High-quality pediatric data directly comparing durations in severe disease are limited, so adult CAP guidance that uses clinical stability criteria to anchor duration is often extrapolated prudently; a total of at least 5 days, continuing until the child achieves stability for 48–72 hours, is reasonable, and longer durations are reserved for slow response, complications, or specific pathogens such as MRSA or Pseudomonas where 7–10 days may be warranted; in all cases, narrow-spectrum therapy should be preferred once the clinical trajectory and local epidemiology allow [^115BfusZ] [^115bxj19] [^11422hz5].

> But wait, what about infants under 3 months. I need to ensure I do not conflate older-child CAP with neonatal pneumonia. For young infants aged 0–59 days with suspected serious bacterial infection including pneumonia, WHO recommends parenteral ampicillin plus gentamicin for at least 7 days, with regimen adjustments for suspected staphylococcal disease; for infants 2–59 months, WHO's standard for severe pneumonia is 5 days of appropriate antibiotics, and many programs allow an early switch to high-dose amoxicillin when clinically stable, underscoring that the 3–5 day paradigm does not apply to neonates [^112ortQg] [^1156FfQ6] [^113LJkz9].

> Next, I should review special situations that alter duration. For parapneumonic effusion or empyema, total antibiotic duration often extends to 2–4 weeks and should be individualized based on drainage adequacy and clinical response. For suspected MRSA, add vancomycin or clindamycin to a beta-lactam and extend therapy toward 7–10 days if response is slow. If there is no clinical improvement within 48–72 hours, I need to reassess for complications, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses and consider repeat imaging or further evaluation before simply prolonging antibiotics [^115Uf1ei] [^117KV1KV] [^111FPYdz].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship implications because duration affects more than cure rates. Shorter courses reduce antibiotic exposure, adverse effects like diarrhea, and selection pressure for resistance; SCOUT-CAP demonstrated fewer antibiotic resistance genes with a 5-day strategy, and multiple meta-analyses show similar or better safety with shorter therapy, reinforcing 5 days as the sweet spot for most children with uncomplicated CAP while aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles [^112YP5Wm] [^116oborn] [^112bYRPQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation and double-check alignment with the evidence. For children aged 6 months and older with uncomplicated, nonsevere CAP managed as outpatients, prescribe 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin when typical bacterial pneumonia is suspected, reassessing for atypical features in school-aged children and adding a macrolide only if there is strong suspicion or confirmed atypical infection. In hospitalized children with uncomplicated disease who are clinically improving, target a total of 5–7 days, ensuring at least 48–72 hours of clinical stability before discontinuation. For infants under 3 months or severe/complicated disease, use longer, individualized courses guided by pathogen risk, drainage needs, and clinical response, with early switch to oral therapy when feasible [^1119rqQt] [^116c2RaS] [^115Fxepd].

> I should confirm first-line agent choice to avoid inadvertently extending duration due to undertreatment. High-dose amoxicillin remains first-line for most previously healthy, appropriately immunized children with suspected bacterial CAP. Narrow-spectrum inpatient agents such as ampicillin or penicillin G are appropriate in many cases, reserving broader therapy for severe presentations or specific epidemiologic risks. Ensuring the right drug and dose reduces the temptation to prolong therapy due to nonresponse and supports timely de-escalation once improved [^115h6tNF] [^116mq1wt] [^111xKjKJ].

> In summary, I need to ensure my bottom line matches the totality of evidence: for children 6 months and older with uncomplicated outpatient CAP, 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin is the evidence-based standard. 3 days can be considered in select, closely monitored settings given CAP-IT but is not yet a universal default. For hospitalized, non-ICU CAP, aim for 5–7 total days once stable. For severe disease or complications, individualize toward 7–10 days based on clinical stability and pathogen. And for infants under 3 months, follow WHO neonatal guidance rather than pediatric CAP duration rules [^1119rqQt] [^115fvY6X] [^112YP5Wm] [^115Fxepd] [^112ortQg].

For pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, **short-course therapy (3–5 days) is as effective as longer courses (7–10 days)** [^115eJ4bj] and is now recommended for uncomplicated cases, with **5 days as the standard** [^113Xbxfo]. This approach reduces adverse effects [^116oxAQZ], improves adherence [^116L3Dg2] [^116c2RaS] [^11422hz5], and lowers resistance pressure [^112YP5Wm] without increasing treatment failure or relapse [^115fvY6X] [^112bYRPQ]. For severe or complicated disease, extend therapy to 7–10 days based on clinical response [^notfound]; for parapneumonic effusion or empyema, continue antibiotics for 2–4 weeks after adequate drainage [^115Uf1ei].

## Evidence supporting shorter antibiotic courses

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have **demonstrated that shorter antibiotic courses are noninferior** to longer courses for pediatric CAP:

- **SAFER trial**: 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin was noninferior to 10 days for clinical cure in children with nonsevere CAP [^1119rqQt].

- **CAP-IT trial**: 3 days of amoxicillin was noninferior to 7 days for retreatment within 28 days [^115fvY6X].

- **SCOUT-CAP trial**: 5 days was superior to 10 days when balancing clinical response and antibiotic-related harms, with fewer antibiotic resistance genes in the short-course group [^112YP5Wm].

- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show no significant differences in clinical cure, treatment failure, or relapse between short (≤ 5 days) and longer (7–10 days) courses [^112bYRPQ] [^116oxAQZ] [^113nK74W].

---

## Clinical outcomes of shorter versus longer antibiotic courses

| **Outcome** | **Short-course (3–5 days)** | **Longer-course (7–10 days)** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clinical cure | Noninferior | Noninferior | High |
| Treatment failure | No significant difference | No significant difference | High |
| Relapse | No significant difference | No significant difference | High |
| Adverse events | Lower incidence | Higher incidence | High |
| Antibiotic resistance | Lower resistance pressure | Higher resistance pressure | Moderate |

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence the appropriate duration** of antibiotic therapy for pediatric CAP:

- **Severity of illness**: Severe or complicated cases may require longer courses (7–10 days) [^116c2RaS].

- **Clinical response**: Persistent symptoms or slow clinical improvement may necessitate extended therapy [^115BfusZ].

- **Patient age**: Younger children (< 2 years) may require individualized assessment due to differing pathogen profiles and clinical course [^115qtSyf].

- **Presence of complications**: Parapneumonic effusion, empyema, or necrotizing pneumonia require prolonged therapy (2–4 weeks) [^115Uf1ei].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines reflect the growing evidence supporting shorter antibiotic courses:

- **IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines**: Recommend 10 days of therapy but acknowledge that shorter courses may be appropriate in mild cases [^116c2RaS].

- **AAFP 2021 guidelines**: Recommend amoxicillin as first-line therapy for pediatric CAP, with duration individualized based on clinical response [^114DFwpz].

- **WHO guidelines**: Recommend 3–5 days for non-severe pneumonia and 7–10 days for severe or complicated cases [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of shorter antibiotic courses

### Benefits

Shorter antibiotic courses offer several advantages: **fewer adverse effects** — such as gastrointestinal disturbances and antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^116oxAQZ] [^116oborn] — improved adherence due to shorter duration [^115vKX89], and reduced resistance pressure from less antibiotic exposure [^112YP5Wm] [^114enJWi].

---

### Risks

Potential risks include a **slightly higher risk of relapse** in select populations, though meta-analyses show no significant difference overall [^112bYRPQ] [^116oxAQZ], and the need for careful monitoring to ensure clinical stability and response [^115BfusZ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants (< 3 months)**: Require careful assessment and individualized therapy due to different pathogen profiles and clinical course [^notfound].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require longer courses and close monitoring [^notfound].

- **Complicated pneumonia**: Requires extended therapy (2–4 weeks) and multidisciplinary management [^115Uf1ei].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Short-course antibiotic therapy (3–5 days) is **effective and safe** for uncomplicated pediatric CAP, with 5 days as the standard duration [^1119rqQt]. Longer courses (7–10 days) are reserved for severe or complicated cases, guided by clinical response and complications [^115Uf1ei] [^115oh5Gj]. This approach balances clinical efficacy with antimicrobial stewardship, minimizing adverse effects and resistance [^112YP5Wm] [^116oxAQZ].

METHODS

Search Strategy

We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science databases on 31 January 2022. The full search strategy is shown in Supplement 1. We used language restriction criteria and only included studies published in English. We also used a time restriction filter and restricted the search only to studies published within the last 20 years (2003–2022). The results were then uploaded to Covidence software (Covidence).

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We included RCTs focusing on antibiotic treatment duration in CAP among children at age ≥ 6 months treated as outpatients, regardless of blinding. We excluded nonrandomized trials and observational studies. We excluded studies conducted in middle- and low-income countries owing to the different definitions of pneumonia and different healthcare facilities and organizations in these countries. Income rankings were based on the list of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development for the year 2020. Furthermore, we excluded studies focusing on atypical pathogens, such as M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Finally, we excluded studies focusing on pneumonia treatment duration in children aged ≥ 6 months.

Review Process

Two authors (I. K. and J. J.) individually screened the abstracts, and conflicts were resolved by a third author (M. R.). Full texts were then assessed by 2 authors (I. K. and J.J.), and data were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet. We used the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies. The risk of bias plot was generated with the robvis package in R software, version 4.0.3. We assessed reporting quality using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

Outcome Measures

Our main outcomes were the need for antibiotic retreatment, hospitalization, or treatment failure (including either need for retreatment or hospitalization) within 1 month after the randomization. Our secondary outcomes were antibiotic-related adverse effects.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^112jBvbp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Appropriate duration of therapy was identified as 5–7 days, based on clinical guidelines available during the study period. More recently, the SAFER, SCOUT-CAP, and CAP-IT trial results have become available, which offer robust clinical evidence in favour of short course treatments (3–5 days). These randomized, multicenter, trials enrolled children (N = 1485) with non-severe CAP. The SAFER trial was a blinded non-inferiority study completed in Canadian emergency departments, concluding that 5-day high-dose amoxicillin therapy was comparable to 10-day. In the United States, the SCOUT-CAP trial examined outpatient, urgent care, as well as emergency settings, and corroborate SAFER results. Moreover, SCOUT-CAP offered the first evidence of reduced antibiotic selective pressure resulting from shorter-courses, by examining antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a post-hoc microbiome analysis. The trial concluded that 5-day treatment reported significantly lower levels of ARGs when compared to longer durations. The CAP-IT non-inferiority trial concluded that 3-day treatment was non-inferior to 7 days of amoxicillin. With results published in 2021/22, all three trials provide irrefutable clinical evidence that short-course should be standard-of-care for non-severe pediatric CAP infection. Across multiple outcomes of interest including: treatment failure, hospitalization, adverse events, short-course (3–5 days) treatments have been identified as equally safe and effective when compared to longer durations (7–10 days). Moreover, shorter durations of therapy increased year-on-year, while 10-day dispensations decreased, indicating an existing trend towards short-course treatment within BC prior to trial result dissemination. The Do Bugs Need Drugs stewardship campaign has been operating at the provincial-level within BC since 2005. These study results offer discrete targets for intervention:(1) encouraging the use of β-lactam antibiotics in lieu of empiric macrolide use, and (2) continued emphasis on 5–7 days of therapy to reduce the risk of bacterial resistance.

### Interpretation of antibiotic trials in pediatric pneumonia [^114d6QBH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent randomized clinical trials have compared antibiotic regimens of varying intensity for the treatment of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). These trials identified no advantage to high-dose vs low-dose amoxicillinor a longer vs shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, with respect to rates or timing of clinical improvement. However, most of these trials enrolled children based solely on clinical criteria or clinician judgment. Given the challenges of diagnosing pediatric pneumonia clinically, it is likely that most children included in studies with clinically suspected CAP did not have radiographic pneumonia and thus would have improved regardless of antibiotic therapy.

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia… [^113o2Hhp]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this 2-center, blinded randomized clinical trial, children treated with short-course antibiotic therapy had comparable rates of clinical cure at 14 to 21 days after enrollment compared with standard care. Meaning Results of this study suggest that short-course therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia not requiring hospitalization offers more benefit than harm and should be considered for inclusion in treatment guidelines. Interventions Five days of high-dose amoxicillin therapy followed by 5 days of placebo vs 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin followed by a different formulation of 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days. Conclusions and Relevance Short-course antibiotic therapy appeared to be comparable to standard care for the treatment of previously healthy children with CAP not requiring hospitalization.

Clinical practice guidelines should consider recommending 5 days of amoxicillin for pediatric pneumonia management in accordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02380352. including small size, 9 lack of blinding, 10 inappropriate study design, 11 and loss of effective blinding12 because of zero clinical failures in a noninferiority study. 13 We conducted an RCT to determine whether, in previously healthy children diagnosed with CAP in the emergency department, 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin led to noninferior rates of clinical cure at 14 to 21 days after enrollment compared with the current standard, 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin. Any participant who clinically deteriorated was asked to return for assessment. Participants all returned at days 14 to 21 for primary outcome measurement. Caregivers were telephoned 1 month after enrollment.

The primary outcome, clinical cure, was defined by all of the following: Initial improvement during the first 4 days after enrollment;. The proportion of participants who experienced clinical cure not requiring additional intervention was more consistent with that of the original cure estimates and was similar between groups. This noninferiority RCT found that, in a population of previously healthy children diagnosed with CAP in Canadian EDs, outcomes associated with the use of 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin were comparable to those associated with the use of 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin. Clinical practice guidelines should consider recommending 5 days of amoxicillin for pediatric pneumonia management in accordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles.

### Short-course versus long-course intravenous therapy with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months [^113LJkz9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia remains the single leading cause of childhood mortality, causing an estimated 1.3 million childhood deaths each year in children under the age of five years. The greater burden of disease occurs in low-income countries, where medical resources and hospital-based management are poor. The World Health Organization (WHO) current evidence summaries recommend intravenous antibiotics for five days as first-line treatment for severe pneumonia. Although there is controversy around the specificity of clinical features in the diagnosis of pneumonia, the criteria for the diagnosis of severe pneumonia are better defined and widely used to triage children for referral and second-line therapy. Approximately 120 million new cases of pneumonia occur globally each year in children under five years of age, of which 14 million progress to severe episodes. Hospitalisation for severe pneumonia in children places a significant burden on both patients and their families, including substantial expense, loss of routine and decrease in quality of life. By reducing the duration of treatment in the hospital, this burden could potentially be lessened and possibly lead to better treatment compliance.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous therapy with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children aged two months to 59 months.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 4, 2015) and EMBASE (1974 to February 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous antibiotic therapy for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months. We excluded children with any other debilitating disease, including those infected with HIV and we excluded children with signs and symptoms of very severe pneumonia (i.e. unable to drink or breast feed, vomiting, lethargic, unconscious, convulsing, central cyanosis, severe respiratory distress or clinically severe malnutrition). We also excluded children who had developed pneumonia during their hospital stay (i.e. with nosocomial infection). There was no restriction on the type of antibiotic used, the dose or the frequency of dosing.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We identified 2352 studies, however none fulfilled our pre-defined inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not identify any RCTs comparing a short course (two to three days) of intravenous antibiotics compared to a long course (five days) for severe pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months.

### Procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized trial [^11585mQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 d. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications.

Objective

To assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In a randomized intervention trial, 302 consecutive patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were included. Data were assessed at baseline, after 4, 6, and 8 d, and after 6 wk. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. In the procalcitonin group (n = 151), antibiotic treatment was based on serum procalcitonin concentrations as follows: strongly discouraged, less than 0.1 microg/L; discouraged, less than 0.25 microg/L; encouraged, greater than 0.25 microg/L; strongly encouraged, greater than 0.5 microg/L. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use; secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcome.

Results

At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 d; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. After adjustment for Pneumonia Severity Index, the hazard ratio of antibiotic discontinuation was higher in the procalcitonin group than in the control group (3.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 4.2). Outcome was similar in both groups, with an overall success rate of 83%.

Conclusions

Procalcitonin guidance substantially reduces antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia. These findings may have important clinical and public health implications.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Q6Lmr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The main result of this meta-analysis on the duration of antibiotic courses in children treated for CAP as outpatients was that a short antibiotic course of 3–5 days was not inferior to a long course of 7–10 days (the recommendation in the currently available guidelines). The analysis included 4 RCTs from high-income countries with a total of 1451 children aged ≥ 6 months. Treatment failure was defined as the need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month, and the rates were surprisingly similar: 7.9% and 8.0%, respectively. The RD between the arms was 0.1%, and the 95% CI was very narrow, confirming that the result for the primary outcome was reliable. In addition, there was no substantial heterogeneity between the 4 studies for reporting retreatments and hospitalizations within 1 month after starting of primary antibiotics.

Adverse events, which was the secondary outcome of the analyses, were reported in 2 studies and they did not differ between the short-course and long-course treatment arms. Adverse events rates were 62.1% and 61.8%, respectively. These adverse events, such as diarrhea and rash, were mild and were often seen in children during antibiotic treatment. Two studies reported severe adverse events, and such events were seen in 0.3% of the cases, which means that the short-course antibiotic therapy was safe. A previous meta-analysis stated that each additional day of antibiotic treatment increases the rates of antibiotic-related adverse effects. Two of the included studies also analyzed the effects of treatment duration on antibiotic resistance and found the shorter course to be more beneficial, but we did not include this as an outcome in the meta-analysis.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of refractory disease), IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to obtain ≥ 1 of the following evaluations in pediatric patients not responding to initial therapy after 48–72 hours:

- clinical and laboratory assessment of the current severity of illness and anticipated progression in order to determine whether higher levels of care or support are required

- imaging evaluation to assess the extent and progression of the pneumonic or parapneumonic process

- further investigations to identify whether the original pathogen persists, the original pathogen has developed resistance to the agent used, or there is a new secondary infecting agent.

### Short-course versus long-course intravenous therapy with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months [^1119rYK2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood mortality from infectious disease, responsible for an estimated 1.3 million deaths annually in children under five years of age, many of which are in low-income countries. The World Health Organization recommends intravenous antibiotics for five days as first-line treatment for children with severe pneumonia. Although controversy exists regarding the specific clinical features used to diagnose pneumonia, the criteria for diagnosis of severe pneumonia are better defined and are widely used to triage children for referral and second-line therapy. In 2011 it was estimated that approximately 120 million new cases of pneumonia occur globally each year in children under five years of age, of which 14 million become severe episodes. Hospitalisation for severe pneumonia in children places a significant burden on both patients and their families, including substantial expense, loss of routine, and decrease in quality of life. By reducing the duration of hospital treatment, healthcare burdens could potentially be reduced and treatment compliance may improve. This is an update of a review published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous therapy (alone or in combination with oral antibiotics) with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to December week 3, 2016), Embase (1974 to 22 December 2016), and four trials registers (23 August 2017), together with reference checking of all relevant trials and reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous antibiotic therapy (alone or in combination with oral antibiotics) for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months. We excluded children with any other debilitating disease, including those infected with HIV. We also excluded children who had developed pneumonia during their hospital stay (i.e. with nosocomial infection). There was no restriction on the type of antibiotic used, the dose, or the frequency of dosing.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Our searches identified 4295 records, however no studies met our predefined inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified no randomised controlled trials comparing a short course (two to three days) of intravenous antibiotics compared to a long course (five days) for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months that met our inclusion criteria.

### Short-course antibiotic treatment for community-acquired alveolar pneumonia in ambulatory children: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116KCNsK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies on short-course treatment of childhood pneumonia in the developed world are lacking. We compared clinical and laboratory outcomes of a 3-day or a 5-day to a 10-day treatment in young children with community-acquired alveolar pneumonia.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 2 stages: (1) 3 days versus 10 days and (2) 5 days versus 10 days. Amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/d; divided into 3 daily doses) was used for all arms. Case definition was: age 6–59 months; radiologically confirmed community-acquired alveolar pneumonia; temperature ≥ 38.5°C; peripheral white blood cell count ≥ 15,000/mm³; status permitting outpatient treatment. Scheduled visits were on days 4–5 and 10–14 with daily telephone interviews for 30 days. Treatment failure was defined by the need for a rescue treatment or hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were: duration of fever and symptoms and white blood cell and C-reactive protein responses.

Results

During Stage 1, 4/10 (40%) and 0/12 (0%) evaluable patients failed in the 3-day and 10-day arms, respectively (P = 0.16). Therefore, the 3-day arm was replaced by a 5-day arm (Stage 2). No failures occurred in the 5-day (n = 56) and 10-day (n = 59) arms. Overall, 4/10 (0%), 0/56 and 0/42 (0%) children failed in the 3-day, 5-day and 10-day arms, respectively (P < 0.001, 3-day versus 5-day or 10-day). Secondary outcomes were similar in the 5-day and 10-day arms.

Conclusion

In 6- to 59-month-old outpatients with community-acquired alveolar pneumonia, a 5-day course with high-dose oral amoxicillin was not inferior to a 10-day course. The 3-day regimen may be associated with an unacceptable failure rate.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^1168oXJ4]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Continued surveillance of antibiotic use is integral to dissuade bacterial resistance. Despite decades of surveillance evaluating quantity, this is the first study to examine outpatient antibiotic prescribing quality for pediatric CAP. Moreover, this study is the first in Canada to examine prescribing quality by agent, dose and duration. Promoting the use of first-line agents, and shifting to reflect evidence-based short-course treatment are targets for stewardship. Study results highlight the importance of examining the quality of prescriptions across other common indications, to inform and equip stewardship interventions.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^111XgpUc]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), however rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose and duration.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1 2014 to December 31 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

Result(S)

A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%) Macrolides accounted for the majority on non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by a previous course of antibiotics.

Conclusion(S)

This study is the first in Canada to examine prescribing quality for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Utilizing first-line agents, and shorter-course treatments are targets for stewardship.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^11422hz5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

### Short treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia [^116m9x7m]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lower respiratory tract infections are one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in community and hospital settings. Usual guidelines for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend 5–7days of antibiotic treatment. In daily practice, physicians often prescribe 9–10days of antibiotic treatment. Among available strategies to decrease antibiotic use, possibly preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing treatment durations is the safest and the most acceptable to clinicians. We aim to review data evaluating the efficacy of short antibiotic duration in adult CAP and which criteria can help clinicians to reduce antibiotic treatment.

Recent Findings

Several studies and meta-analyses demonstrated that the treatment duration of 7days or less was sufficient for CAP. Two trials found that 3-day treatments were effective, even in hospitalized CAP. To customize and shorten duration, clinical and biological criteria have been studied and reflect patient's response. Indeed, stability criteria were recently shown to be effective to discontinue antibiotic treatment. Procalcitonin was also studied but never compared with clinical criteria.

Summary

Treatment duration for CAP is still under debate, but several studies support short durations. Clinical criteria could be possibly used to discontinue antibiotic treatment.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113mw8Q2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines, dose and duration

Clinical practice guidelines and treatment recommendations were extracted from Bugs & Drugs, a provincial reference, as well as: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAPS), Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the British Thoracic Society (BTS). Guidelines were reviewed and first-line agent(s), dosing and duration extracted. Treatment recommendations for β-lactam allergies were excluded as medication allergies are recorded but remain unavailable in PharmaNet data.

Amoxicillin [40–90 mg/Kg/day; max 4 g/day; x 5–7 days] was the primary treatment for outpatient pediatric CAP. Alternative first-line treatments included: Penicillin [25–50 mg/Kg/day; max 2 g/day; x 5–7 days]; Ampicillin [50–100 mg/Kg/day; max 2 g/day; x 5–7 days]; and Amoxicillin-clavulanate [90 mg/Kg/day; max 4 g/Kg/day; x 5–7 days]. Average daily dose was stratified by patient age, and calculated utilizing WHO growth charts for Canada. For each age, a daily dosing range was calculated. The 3rd and 97th percentile weights at the mid-point (i.e. 6.5 years for a 6-year-old) were determined for each sex. Per age and sex, the lowest 3rd percentile weight was multiplied by the lowest dose (e.g. 40 mg for amoxicillin) to calculate the minimum daily dose. The highest 97th percentile was multiplied by the highest dose (e.g. 90 mg for amoxicillin) to calculate the maximum; up to the maximum daily dose stated in guidelines (e.g. 4 g for amoxicillin).

Published in 2012, provincial guidelines state that 5–7 days is the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment. Other guidelines put forth by the AAPS and IDSA, during our study period, do include longer durations (7–10 days), however given the scope of our study is limited to BC, regionally-specific recommendations were prioritized.

### Unique considerations in the evaluation of antibacterials in clinical trials for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia [^113EYeqR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

There are few placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trials of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. The reduction in mortality seen in early trials of antibacterials for treatment of bacterial CAP in adults and children was dramatic and led to the adoption of antibacterial therapy as the standard of care for CAP in both adults and children. Because of the efficacy of antibacterials for treatment of CAP in adults and the reluctance of society to place children at risk of adverse outcomes in placebo-controlled clinical trials, pediatric investigations of this type were not performed after 1940. Instead, comparative trials were subsequently conducted and reported. More recently, comparative trials using a noninferiority trial design have been used by regulatory agencies to grant approval of antibiotic therapy for pediatric CAP. We cannot reliably distinguish between pneumonia cases caused by bacterial, viral, or atypical pathogens among the relatively homogeneous population of children with CAP who are enrolled into clinical trials. Patient- or parent-reported outcomes represent an option for appropriate, defined clinical trial outcomes for pediatric CAP, because the disease in children has a relatively short and potentially self-resolving clinical course. Clinical trials that require invasive techniques for diagnosis and placebo-controlled randomized trials are not acceptable for children, who are considered to be a vulnerable population.

### Short-course vs long-course antibiotic therapy for children with nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oborn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Short-course antibiotic therapy could enhance adherence and reduce adverse drug effects and costs. However, based on sparse evidence, most guidelines recommend a longer course of antibiotics for nonsevere childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Objective

To determine whether a shorter course of antibiotics was noninferior to a longer course for childhood nonsevere CAP.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and 3 Chinese databases from inception to March 31, 2022, as well as clinical trial registries and Google.com.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing a shorter- vs longer-course therapy using the same oral antibiotic for children with nonsevere CAP were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Random-effects models were used to pool the data, which were analyzed from April 15, 2022, to May 15, 2022. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to rate the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment failure, defined by persistence of pneumonia or the new appearance of any general danger signs of CAP (eg, lethargy, unconsciousness, seizures, or inability to drink), elevated temperature (> 38 °C) after completion of treatment, change of antibiotic, hospitalization, death, missing more than 3 study drug doses, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of informed consent.

Results

Nine randomized clinical trials including 11 143 participants were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 98% of the participants were aged 2 to 59 months, and 58% were male. Eight studies with 10 662 patients reported treatment failure. Treatment failure occurred in 12.8% vs 12.6% of participants randomized to a shorter vs a longer course of antibiotics. High-quality evidence showed that a shorter course of oral antibiotic was noninferior to a longer course with respect to treatment failure for children with nonsevere CAP (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92–1.11; risk difference, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01; I2 = 0%). A 3-day course of antibiotic treatment was noninferior to a 5-day course for the outcome of treatment failure (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91–1.12; I2 = 0%), and a 5-day course was noninferior to a 10-day course (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.50–1.53; I2 = 0%). A shorter course of antibiotics was associated with fewer reports of gastroenteritis (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.95) and lower caregiver absenteeism (incident rate ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.84).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this meta-analysis suggest that a shorter course of antibiotics was noninferior to a longer course in children aged 2 to 59 months with nonsevere CAP. Clinicians should consider prescribing a shorter course of antibiotics for the management of pediatric nonsevere CAP.

### Clinical pathway revision increases amoxicillin monotherapy and 5-day durations of therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department and urgent care: a quality improvement initiative [^113Xbxfo]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 5-day amoxicillin monotherapy as first-line treatment for pediatric uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia. We aimed to use local quality improvement interventions to increase first-line amoxicillin use, reduce azithromycin use, and increase 5-day therapy durations for uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

A quality improvement initiative took place at a pediatric hospital network, including 4 emergency departments (EDs) and 5 urgent care centers. Children discharged between July 2018 and July 2022 with a community-acquired pneumonia diagnosis and an antibiotic prescribed were included. A 2-part intervention was implemented: (1) an electronic health record order set that preselected 5-day antibiotic therapy (August 2020) and (2) a revised community-acquired pneumonia pathway newly integrated into the electronic health record (April 2021). Proportions of antibiotic encounters receiving amoxicillin, azithromycin, and antibiotic durations of 5 days or fewer were analyzed using statistical process control charts to identify special cause variation.

Results

Order set implementation had no effect on pediatric community-acquired pneumonia prescribing. After pathway revision, amoxicillin prescribing increased from 60.6% to 70.9%, azithromycin prescribing decreased from 12.5% to 3.7%, and durations for 5 days or fewer increased from 2.0% to 66.1%.

Conclusion

A revised, electronic health record-integrated community-acquired pneumonia pathway was associated with improving already high adherence to guideline-recommended antibiotic choice and reducing antibiotic durations for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in ED and urgent care settings. Local quality improvement efforts, when adapted to institutional workflows and culture, can effectively implement clinical pathways to support evidence-based prescribing for uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia across diverse health care settings.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^114enJWi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — shorter versus longer antibiotic duration across infections summarizes randomized trials and meta-analyses spanning community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with explicit day ranges and selected outcome effects. In CAP meta-analysis, adults and children were treated for 3–7 vs 5–10 days with outcomes including clinical success, relapse, mortality, and adverse events. In VAP meta-analyses of adults, regimens of 7–8 vs 10–15 days assessed antibiotic-free days and recurrence; shorter courses were associated with more antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 4.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.26–5.78) and fewer VAP recurrences due to multidrug-resistant organisms (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–.96), but in nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli shorter courses had more recurrences (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.14–4.16). A VAP randomized trial compared 8 vs 15 days, with shorter duration associated with more antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 3.40 days; 95% CI, 1.43–5.37). Additional examples include neonatal septicemia (2–4 vs 7 [with sterile culture]) and vertebral osteomyelitis (42 vs 84), with the table listing corresponding clinical outcomes; CAP and VAP abbreviations are defined on-page as community-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: do we know when, what and for how long to treat? [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^111gxbE3]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study showed that first-line agents, concordant with guideline recommendations, accounted for over half of prescriptions issued for pediatric CAP while a remaining 44% of prescriptions were categorized as "not recommended". Overall, 27% of antibiotic use in BC was fully guideline adherent. Prescriptions classified as effective but unnecessary, were 97% attributable to excessive duration of therapy. Moreover, half of under treatment was attributable to subtherapeutic dose in tandem to excess duration. Provincial pediatric guidelines have included evidence for shorter durations since 2012, preceding our study period. IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines also cite strong recommendations for shorter duration despite moderate evidence at the time. Results for several clinical trials have since been disseminated which provide concrete evidence in support of short course treatment.

To our knowledge, this is the first study examining agent, dose and duration, to assess antibiotic prescribing in pediatric CAP. Although Frost et al. evaluated guideline-concordant prescribing for upper respiratory illnesses in children, they did not consider dose or duration. Furthermore, a study in China assessed prescribing for respiratory infections and found that the three most prescribed agents were discordant with guideline recommendations, but dose/duration was not considered.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children [^113iffQj]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of childhood mortality globally. In the United States, CAP is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization and antibiotic use and is associated with substantial morbidity. There has been a dramatic shift in microbiological etiologies for CAP in children over time as pneumococcal pneumonia has become less common and viral etiologies have become predominant. There is no commonly agreed on approach to the diagnosis of CAP in children. When indicated, antimicrobial treatment should consist of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. In this article, we will describe the current understanding of the microbiological etiologies, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, risk factors, treatment, and future directions in the diagnosis and management of pediatric CAP.

### How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia? [^116L3Dg2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The studies reviewed in this article suggest that a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy is comparable to standard therapy in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and promotes reduction of adverse events, microbial resistance, cost, and improved patient compliance.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7–14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.

### Improving short course treatment of pediatric infections: a randomized quality improvement trial [^111S4rAF]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Short courses of antibiotic treatment are effective for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). We compared the effectiveness of education with performance feedback, clinical decision support (CDS), and the combination in encouraging appropriately short treatment courses by primary care clinicians.

Methods

We designed a site-randomized, quality improvement trial within a large pediatric primary care network. Each practice was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: education and feedback; CDS; both interventions ("combined group"); and control. We performed difference-in-differences analysis to compare the proportion of cases with short course treatment before and after intervention among the 4 groups.

Results

For all cases of CAP and SSTI, the proportion in the control group treated with the recommended duration did not change from the baseline period (26.1% [679 of 2603]) to the intervention period (25.8% [196 of 761]; p = 0.9). For the education and feedback group, the proportion rose from 22.3% (428 of 1925) to 45.0% (239 of 532; P < .001); for the CDS group, from 26.6% (485 of 1824) to 52.3% (228 of 436; P < .001); and for the combined group, from 26.2% (491 of 1875) to 67.8% (314 of 463; P < .001). A difference-in-differences analysis showed that all 3 intervention groups improved performance compared with the control group (P < .001); the combined group had greater improvement than the education and feedback group or the CDS group (P < .001).

Conclusions

In this quality improvement project to encourage shorter duration treatment of CAP and SSTI, both education with performance feedback and CDS were effective in modifying clinician behavior; however, the combination of the two was substantially more effective than either strategy alone.

### Systematic review on antibiotic therapy for pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age [^113cecd2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a force to reckon with, as it accounts for 1.1 million of all deaths in children less than 5 years of age globally, with disproportionately higher mortality occurring in the low and middle income-countries (LMICs) of Southeast Asia and Africa. Existing strategies to curb pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality have not effectively translated into meaningful control of pneumonia-related burden. In the present systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of trials conducted in LMICs to determine the most suitable antibiotic therapy for treating pneumonia (very severe, severe and non-severe). While previous reviews, including the most recent review by Lodha et al, have focused either on single modality of antibiotic therapy (such as choice of antibiotic) or children under the age of 16 years, the current review updates evidence on the choice of drug, duration, route and combination of antibiotics in children specifically between 2 and 59 months of age. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the route, dose, combination and duration of antibiotics in the management of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP. Study participants included children between 2 and 59 months of age with CAP. All available titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by two review authors independently. All data was entered and analysed using Review Manager 5 software. The review identified 8122 studies on initial search, of which 22 studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. Evidence from these trials showed a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin to be effective for managing very severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age, and oral amoxicillin to be equally efficacious, as other parenteral antibiotics for managing severe pneumonia in children of this particular age group. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia as well. The review further found a short 3 day course of antibiotics to be equally beneficial as 5 day course for managing non-severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age. This review updates evidence on the general spectrum of antibiotic recommendation for CAP in children between 2 and 59 months of age, which is an age group that warrants special focus owing to its high disease and mortality burden. Evidence derived from the review found oral amoxicillin to be equally effective as parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in the 2–59 month age group, which holds important implications for LMICs where parenteral drug administration is an issue. Also, the review's finding that 3 day course of antibiotic is equally effective as 5 day course for non-severe pneumonia for 2–59 months of age is again beneficial for LMICs, as a shorter therapy will be associated with a lower cost. The review addresses some research gaps in antibiotic treatment for CAP as well, and this crucial information is presented with the aim of providing a targeted cure for the middle and low income setting.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115eJ4bj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment duration of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children has been controversial in high-income countries. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare short antibiotic treatment (3–5 days) with longer treatment (7–10 days) among children aged ≥ 6 months.

Methods

On 31 January 2022, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published in English from 2003 to 2022. We included randomized controlled trials focusing on antibiotic treatment duration in children with CAP treated as outpatients. We calculated risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals and used the fixed-effect model (low heterogeneity). Our main outcome was treatment failure, defined as need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month. Our secondary outcome was presence of antibiotic-related harms.

Results

A total of 541 studies were screened, and 4 studies with 1541 children were included in the review. Three studies had low risk of bias, and one had some concerns. All 4 studies assessed treatment failures, and the RD was 0.1% (95% confidence interval, -3.0% to 2.0%) with high quality of evidence. Two studies (1194 children) assessed adverse events related to antibiotic treatment, and the RD was 0.0% (-5.0% to 5.0%) with moderate quality of evidence. The diagnostic criteria varied between the included studies.

Conclusions

A short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was equally effective and safe compared with the longer (current) recommendation of 7–10 days in children aged ≥ 6 months with CAP. We suggest that short antibiotic courses can be implemented in treatment of pediatric CAP.

### Don't treat uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia… [^1149ZQ8L]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia accounts for a significant percentage of antibiotic use in children. Unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, have been shown to contribute to antibiotic resistance and C. difficile infection. The most common cause of CAP in healthy, immunized children is Streptococcus pneumoniae, of which most strains are highly susceptible to penicillin/ampicillin. As ampicillin achieves high levels in the lung and is narrow in spectrum, it should be used as a first-line drug for inpatient management of most children with uncomplicated pediatric CAP. In cases with more resistant local epidemiology, or complicated CAP including empyema, antibiotics with a broader spectrum may be needed.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^115C8Zf2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia remains one of the leading global causes of mortality particularly in children, and older adults. In Canada, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) encompasses infections outside of a hospital setting. Up to 80% of patients with pneumonia are treated in the community, however the etiology of CAP is heterogeneous with both bacterial and viral etiologies prevalent in children. Underlying pathogens can include S. pneumoniae however viral infections, and mixed bacterial-viral infections are common, contributing to the complexity of pathogen detection and treatment. In light of this heterogeneity, physicians rarely have knowledge of precise etiology, and treatment is commonly empiric in nature.

The evaluation of outpatient prescribing is often contingent on patient factors not captured within routine, administrative health data. Prior efforts to overcome gaps include the establishment of expected, or maximal, prescribing rates in order to create a benchmark against which antibiotic use may be contextualized. Most often generated using expert consensus methodology, these markers are inherently limited by participant self-selection, physician biases to specific populations, and issues with reliability/external validity. Moreover, these results provide high-level interpretations of appropriate use, which has been subject to criticism given the lack of robust patient information to sufficiently elucidate prescription quality. Efforts are further limited by the absence of standardized nomenclature.

This retrospective cohort study is the first in Canada to examine the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions issued for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, in outpatient care. In British Columbia (BC), Canada Bugs & Drugs™ is a provincially utilized clinical reference, published in 2012. The objective of this study was to utilize this resource, as well as other relevant practice guidelines available during the study period, to examine appropriate antibiotic use. The use of guidelines to define categories of prescribing offer a novel, objective interpretation of prescribing quality when compared to previous efforts of expert opinion. Our objectives were to determine the quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Appropriate use by agent was hypothesized to account for a majority of antibiotic use, while duration of therapy was expected to exceed guideline recommendations.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of community acquired pneumonia in children [^114sepNQ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Childhood community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) may be limited by method of development, scope of recommendations and the quality of supporting evidence. This study systematically identified, appraised and compared the recommendations of CPGs for the management of paediatric CAP using the AGREE II tool. The systematic review yielded 1409 non-duplicate results, of which 14 CPGs were appraised. Four of the fourteen CPGs were deemed high quality. Most CPGs were considered low-medium quality with 'rigour of development' and 'applicability' the weakest domains. These areas should be considered in deriving CPGs in the future. Recommendations were generally similar across all guidelines; however, there was notable heterogeneity in three areas. This suggests the need for further evidence to guide management decisions on oxygen saturation thresholds for admission, the utility of investigations such as acute phase reactants, and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Table 2
Rate of antibiotic use for pediatric CAP by category of prescribing quality

1 rate ratios compare prescribing in 2018 against 2014; 2 guideline adherent: concordant to first-line agent, dose and duration; 3 effective but unnecessary: concordant to first-line agent with dose and/or duration discordant; 4 under treatment: concordant to first-line agent with dose and/or duration discordant; 5 not recommended: discordant to first-line agent

Stratified by age, patterns of use vary across prescribing categories (Fig. 2). Guideline adherent prescriptions were most pronounced in children aged < 2 years. Effective but unnecessary use was highest in the youngest ages, with a negative association to increasing age. By age 14, only 1% of prescriptions were effective but unnecessary, in contrast to 25% in children aged ≤ 1 year. Under treatment demonstrated an opposite shift over time, with increasing age leading to increased proportions, particularly in children aged 14 years and older wherein under treatment accounted for 21% of antibiotic use, compared to 4% in younger ages. Not recommended prescriptions accounted for the highest magnitudes of use for children aged ≥ 3 years, with a positive association to increased age. By age 18, 75% of antibiotic use was categorized as not recommended. In contrast, guideline adherent accounted for the majority of prescriptions issued to children aged ≤ 2 years (35%). When stratified by sex, no marked differences were revealed.

Overall percentage of outpatient antibiotic use for pediatric CAP by category of prescription quality by age

Not recommended prescribing

In total, 56% of antibiotics were concordant with guideline recommended first-line treatments. The remaining 44% were composed of other antibiotic agents, and subsequently categorized as "not recommended". By the end of our study period, proportions of not recommended prescribing decreased by 44%, suggesting a positive trend towards guideline concordant first-line use [RR: 0.66: 95% CI: 0.6–0.7].

The majority of "not recommended" (86%) antibiotics were macrolides (ATC class: J01F). Moreover, 73% of these prescriptions could be attributed to either clarithromycin (44%), or azithromycin (29%) specifically. Other antibiotics included those belonging to ATC class J01D (other β-lactams; 9%); and J01A (tetracyclines; 3%). The remaining 1.7% of "not recommended" antibiotics were other agents not listed above.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nd7cJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The current standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children < 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the current treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over current treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes of normal flora to antibiotics, which diminishes the selection pressure for emergence of resistant strains. In addition, unnecessary long courses increase the risk of adverse events, such as diarrhea, which is common in young children treated with antibiotics.

This meta-analysis comprising RCTs focused on antibiotic treatment duration of CAP in children treated as outpatients in high-income countries. Our primary aim was to determine whether a short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was as effective and safe as the longer treatment duration of 7–10 days. In addition, we evaluated antibiotic-related adverse events as a secondary objective of the study.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113yRnEL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Our study period included a total of 28,307 patients, with 54% male and a mean age of 6.5 years (Table 1). Overall, there were 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP in BC, between 2014 and 2018. Of those, 32,469 episodes resulted in a prescription, with a proportion of 76% total CAP episodes prescribed (Table 1). The age distribution of patients by sex shows that 72% of antibiotics were dispensed to children aged 1–6 years (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Table 1
Cohort Characteristics

1 Population Data BC determines neighborhood income quintile (i.e. household size-adjusted measure of household income) using a postal code-based algorithm standardized by Statistics Canada; 2 Rural status represents local population of 1000 to 29 999; urban status represents local population ≥ 30 000; 3 acute episodes (< 30 days) of pediatric CAP regardless of associated-antibiotic prescription; 4 acute episodes (< 30 days) that received an antibiotic prescription within 5 days of episode end date; 5 proportion prescribed as: [# episodes prescribed / # total episodes]

Amoxicillin comprised 51% of all prescriptions in the five study years. The majority (53%) of amoxicillin prescriptions were categorized as fully guideline adherent. Alternative first-line treatments for CAP included: amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin and penicillin, which accounted for an additional 5% of prescribing, for a total of 56% first-line agent use. Overall, 44% of prescriptions were classified as not recommended, followed by 27% guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, and 10% under treatment (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Percentage of outpatient antibiotic use for pediatric CAP by category of prescription quality by year

When compared to 2014, guideline adherent prescribing significantly increased by the final study year [RR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.6–1.8] (Table 2). Effective but unnecessary use also demonstrated an increase, while under treatment and not recommended prescribing decreased (Table 2). Durations exceeding 5–7 days were the primary characteristic of inappropriate prescribing, accounting for 97% of all effective but unnecessary antibiotic use (Supplementary Table 2). Sub therapeutic dosing was responsible for 50% of under treatment antibiotic use, while the remainder could be attributed to both sub therapeutic dosing and excess duration.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^1173My9Z]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The results of our study indicate that the quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric CAP could be improved in numerous ways. Agent selection and duration of therapy most significantly, as these two components of prescribing account for 86% of total inappropriate antibiotic use. Further analyses revealed that the use of macrolides (e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin) accounted for almost all non first-line agent prescriptions. Macrolides are only indicated if the patient has a severe β-lactam allergy, or if an atypical pathogen (e.g. Mycoplasma or Chlamydia species) is suspected as the causative pathogen. Although both allergy and etiology data were unavailable, it is improbable that 44% of all BC children met these criteria. Moreover, provincial data on bacterial resistance and susceptibility patterns do not support the empirical replacement of β-lactams with macrolides, given the resistance rates to S.pneumoniae are close to 25%, the cut-off suggested by IDSA guidelines to avoid empiric macrolide use. A previous study reviewing antibiotic use in Canada also found high macrolide use, and this has been corroborated across several studies in the United States (US). Lipsett et al. report that 43% of all antibiotic prescribing for pediatric CAP in the US is attributable to macrolide monotherapy, with a positive association between increasing age and macrolide prescribing. We also showed a clear association between increasing levels of "not recommended" prescribing, with increasing patient age. Although atypical etiology is more common in older children/adolescents, amoxicillin is still recommended, with a macrolide to follow in treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis revealed that only 32% of not recommended prescribing was preceded by a different course of antibiotics. Of these prescriptions, ¾ were macrolides, and 70% were preceded by a β-lactam prescription. This result leaves a significant proportion of not recommended prescribing unexplained by the suspicion of Mycoplasma pneumoniae or other atypical pathogens. Although macrolide antibiotics may be justified in the treatment of atypical pathogenesis, S. pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen for pediatric CAP. Given that not recommended prescribing accounted for up to ¾ of antibiotic use in older children, it is unlikely that the empiric use of macrolides can be fully explained by true atypical infection. Reducing the empiric use of broad-spectrum macrolides in the wake of rising Canadian rates of drug resistant M. pneumoniae presents a target for provincial stewardship programs.

### Short-vs standard-course outpatient antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in children: the SCOUT-CAP randomized clinical trial [^112YP5Wm]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics. Shorter courses may be effective with fewer adverse effects and decreased potential for antibiotic resistance.

Objective

To compare a short (5-day) vs standard (10-day) antibiotic treatment strategy for CAP in young children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in outpatient clinic, urgent care, or emergency settings in 8 US cities. A total of 380 healthy children aged 6 to 71 months with nonsevere CAP demonstrating early clinical improvement were enrolled from December 2, 2016, to December 16, 2019. Data were analyzed from January to September 2020.

Intervention

On day 6 of their originally prescribed therapy, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 5 days of matching placebo or 5 additional days of the same antibiotic.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the end-of-treatment response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (RADAR), a composite end point that ranks each child's clinical response, resolution of symptoms, and antibiotic-associated adverse effects in an ordinal desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR). Within each DOOR rank, participants were further ranked by the number of antibiotic days, assuming that shorter antibiotic durations were more desirable. Using RADAR, the probability of a more desirable outcome was estimated for the short- vs standard-course strategy. In a subset of children, throat swabs were collected between study days 19 and 25 to quantify antibiotic resistance genes in oropharyngeal flora.

Results

A total of 380 children (189 randomized to short course and 191 randomized to standard course) made up the study population. The mean (SD) age was 35.7 (17.2) months, and 194 participants (51%) were male. Of the included children, 8 were Asian, 99 were Black or African American, 234 were White, 32 were multiracial, and 7 were of unknown or unreported race; 33 were Hispanic or Latino, 344 were not Hispanic or Latino, and 3 were of unknown or unreported ethnicity. There were no differences between strategies in the DOOR or its individual components. Fewer than 10% of children in either strategy had an inadequate clinical response. The short-course strategy had a 69% (95% CI, 63–75) probability of a more desirable RADAR outcome compared with the standard-course strategy. A total of 171 children were included in the resistome analysis. The median (range) number of antibiotic resistance genes per prokaryotic cell (RGPC) was significantly lower in the short-course strategy compared with the standard-course strategy for total RGPC (1.17 [0.35–2.43] vs 1.33 [0.46–11.08]; p = 0.01) and β-lactamase RGPC (0.55 [0.18–1.24] vs 0.60 [0.21–2.45]; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, among children responding to initial treatment for outpatient CAP, a 5-day antibiotic strategy was superior to a 10-day strategy. The shortened approach resulted in similar clinical response and antibiotic-associated adverse effects, while reducing antibiotic exposure and resistance.

### Hospital outcomes associated with guideline-recommended antibiotic therapy for pediatric pneumonia [^112K5cPb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recent national guidelines recommend use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy as empiric treatment for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, clinical outcomes associated with adoption of this recommendation have not been studied.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included children age 3 months to 18 years, hospitalized with CAP from May 2, 2011 through July 30, 2012. Primary exposure of interest was empiric antibiotic therapy, classified as guideline recommended or not. Primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), total hospital costs, and inpatient pharmacy costs. Secondary outcomes included broadened antibiotic therapy, emergency department revisits, and readmissions. Multivariable linear regression and Fisher exact test were performed to determine the association of guideline-recommended antibiotic therapy on outcomes.

Results

Empiric guideline-recommended therapy was prescribed to 168 (76%) of 220 patients. Median hospital LOS was 1.3 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.9–1.9 days), median total cost of index hospitalization was $4097 (IQR: $2657-$6054), and median inpatient pharmacy cost was $91 (IQR: $40-$183). Between patients who did and did not receive guideline-recommended therapy, there were no differences in LOS (adjusted -5.8% change; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -22.1 to 12.8), total costs (adjusted -10.9% change; 95% CI: -27.4 to 9.4), or inpatient pharmacy costs (adjusted 14.8% change; 95% CI: -43.4 to 27.1). Secondary outcomes were rare, with no difference in unadjusted analysis between patients who did and did not receive guideline-recommended therapy.

Conclusions

Use of guideline-recommended antibiotic therapy was not associated with unintended negative consequences; there were no changes in LOS, total costs, or inpatient pharmacy costs.

### Unsolved problems in the approach to pediatric community-acquired pneumonia [^1168J2FA]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses unsolved problems concerning pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and identifies the areas of research that need to be developed.

Recent Findings

Diagnosing pediatric CAP and the required hospitalization are difficult problems especially in the presence of mild signs and symptoms. It is frequently not possible to identify the cause of this disease, and this explains why antibiotics are unnecessarily prescribed in some cases. The treatment recommendations for severe CAP are better defined than those for mild and moderate CAP.

Summary

It is possible to prepare recommendations for most of the problems that emerge in severe cases of pediatric CAP even though its cause can also be difficult to identify. However, the recommended approach to mild or moderate cases is always based on mainly moderate or poor quality evidence. There is an urgent need for further studies aimed at defining first-line and second-line antibiotic therapy for mild and moderate CAP. In the absence of new data, it is necessary to be aware that a substantial number of patients will not be optimally treated.

### A national quality improvement collaborative to improve antibiotic use in pediatric infections [^113VnXuX]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nearly 25% of antibiotics prescribed to children are inappropriate or unnecessary, subjecting patients to avoidable adverse medication effects and cost.

Methods

We conducted a quality improvement initiative across 118 hospitals participating in the American Academy of Pediatrics Value in Inpatient Pediatrics Network 2020 to 2022. We aimed to increase the proportion of children receiving appropriate: (1) empirical, (2) definitive, and (3) duration of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections to ≥ 85% by Jan 1, 2022. Sites reviewed encounters of children > 60 days old evaluated in the emergency department or hospital. Interventions included monthly audit with feedback, educational webinars, peer coaching, order sets, and a mobile app containing site-specific, antibiogram-based treatment recommendations. Sites submitted 18 months of baseline, 2-months washout, and 10 months intervention data. We performed interrupted time series (analyses for each measure.

Results

Sites reviewed 43916 encounters (30799 preintervention, 13117 post). Overall median [interquartile range] adherence to empirical, definitive, and duration of antibiotic therapy was 67% [65% to 70%]; 74% [72% to 75%] and 61% [58% to 65%], respectively at baseline and was 72% [71% to 72%]; 79% [79% to 80%] and 71% [69% to 73%], respectively, during the intervention period. Interrupted time series revealed a 13% (95% confidence interval: 1% to 26%) intercept change at intervention for empirical therapy and a 1.1% (95% confidence interval: 0.4% to 1.9%) monthly increase in adherence per month for antibiotic duration above baseline rates. Balancing measures of care escalation and revisit or readmission did not increase.

Conclusions

This multisite collaborative increased appropriate antibiotic use for community-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infection among diverse hospitals.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antiviral therapy, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to do not delay antiviral therapy until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Do not exclude influenza disease conclusively in case of negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially rapid antigen tests. Consider initiating treatment after 48 hours of symptomatic infection in patients with more severe disease, as it may still provide clinical benefit.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113E3cWq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Until now, most data on the length of antibiotic courses have come from low-income or middle-income countries. The main differences in relation to the high-income countries concern the definition of CAP by the World Health Organization criteria for developing countries, which highlight increased respiratory rate and rates of severe treatment failure > 5%, which are not acceptable in Western countries.

The main strength of our review is the high quality and low risk of bias of the included studies, which increases the validity of our results. Furthermore, we did not have any major protocol deviations. Moreover, the numbers of cases — 1451 for the primary outcome and 1194 for the secondary outcome of antibiotic-related adverse events — allow reliable meta-analysis. The exclusion of studies focusing on treatment of atypical pneumonias increased the consistency of data, since the necessity to treat them remains open.

A minor limitation to our results is the fact that more than half of the patients were from a single study, but this should not cause bias in the estimates, given that the results were similar in all studies. The main limitation of our study is the differing definition of CAP in the included studies, because 2 of them required chest radiographs and 2 did not. The currently available guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of CAP treated at home is clinical, and imaging is needed only in complicated cases. Viral determinations were performed in only one study, but virus identification does not necessarily influence decision making in CAP, since mixed viral-bacterial infections are common and it is recommended that all pediatric CAP cases in children ≥ 6 months of age are treated with antibiotics. Therefore, future studies should focus more on optimal differential recognition of bacterial and viral pneumonia, and a double-blinded placebo design should be used to determine whether antibiotics are needed at all in mild pneumonia. As seen in a previous study from England, antibiotics did not improve outcomes in nonsevere lower respiratory tract infections.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis, including 4 high-level RCTs, showed that short treatment was equally safe and effective as longer treatment of 7–10 days for CAP in outpatient children aged ≥ 6 months in high-income countries. We suggest that this shorter treatment for 3–5 days can now be implemented into clinical practice.

### Extended versus standard antibiotic course duration in children [^117BHQyp]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High-level evidence is limited for antibiotic duration in children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from First Nations and other at-risk populations of chronic respiratory disorders. As part of a larger study, we determined whether an extended antibiotic course is superior to a standard course for achieving clinical cure at 4 weeks in children 3 months to ≤ 5 years old hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

In our multinational (Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia), double-blind, superiority randomized controlled trial, children hospitalized with uncomplicated, radiographic-confirmed, CAP received 1–3 days of intravenous antibiotics followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (80mg/kg, amoxicillin component, divided twice daily) and then randomized to extended (13–14 days duration) or standard (5–6 days) antibiotics. The primary outcome was clinical cure (complete resolution of respiratory symptoms/signs) 4 weeks postenrollment. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance at 4 weeks.

Results

Of 372 children enrolled, 324 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomized. Using intention-to-treat analysis, between-group clinical cure rates were similar (extended course: n = 127/163, 77.9%; standard course: n = 131/161, 81.3%; relative risk = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.86–1.07). There were no significant between-group differences for adverse events (extended course: n = 43/163, 26.4%; standard course, n = 32/161, 19.9%) or nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus or antimicrobial resistance.

Conclusions

Among children hospitalized with pneumonia and at-risk of chronic respiratory illnesses, an extended antibiotic course was not superior to a standard course at achieving clinical cure at 4 weeks. Additional research will identify if an extended course provides longer-term benefits.

### Short-course versus long-course therapy of the same antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia in adolescent and adult outpatients [^116JyveS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lung infection that can be acquired during day-to-day activities in the community (not while receiving care in a hospital). Community-acquired pneumonia poses a significant public health burden in terms of mortality, morbidity, and costs. Shorter antibiotic courses for CAP may limit treatment costs and adverse effects, but the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment is uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-course versus longer-course treatment with the same antibiotic at the same daily dosage for CAP in non-hospitalised adolescents and adults (outpatients). We planned to investigate non-inferiority of short-course versus longer-term course treatment for efficacy outcomes, and superiority of short-course treatment for safety outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and three trials registers on 28 September 2017 together with conference proceedings, reference checking, and contact with experts and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short- and long-courses of the same antibiotic for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to use standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

Our searches identified 5260 records. We did not identify any RCTs that compared short- and longer-courses of the same antibiotic for the treatment of adolescents and adult outpatients with CAP. We excluded two RCTs that compared short courses (five compared to seven days) of the same antibiotic at the same daily dose because they evaluated antibiotics (gemifloxacin and telithromycin) not commonly used in practice for the treatment of CAP. In particular, gemifloxacin is no longer approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CAP due to its questionable risk-benefit balance, and reported adverse effects. Moreover, the safety profile of telithromycin is also cause for concern. We found one ongoing study that we will assess for inclusion in future updates of the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no eligible RCTs that studied a short-course of antibiotic compared to a longer-course (with the same antibiotic at the same daily dosage) for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients. The effects of antibiotic therapy duration for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients remains unclear.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: the SAFER randomized clinical trial [^1119rqQt]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common occurrence in childhood; consequently, evidence-based recommendations for its treatment are required.

Objective

To determine whether 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin for CAP was associated with noninferior rates of clinical cure compared with 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The SAFER (Short-Course Antimicrobial Therapy for Pediatric Respiratory Infections) study was a 2-center, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial consisting of a single-center pilot study from December 1, 2012, to March 31, 2014, and the follow-up main study from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019 at the emergency departments of McMaster Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Research staff, participants, and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Eligible children were aged 6 months to 10 years and had fever within 48 hours, respiratory symptoms, chest radiography findings consistent with pneumonia as per the emergency department physician, and a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. Children were excluded if they required hospitalization, had comorbidities that would predispose them to severe disease and/or pneumonia of unusual origin, or had previous β-lactam antibiotic therapy. Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 8, 2020.

Interventions

Five days of high-dose amoxicillin therapy followed by 5 days of placebo (intervention group) vs 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin followed by a different formulation of 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin (control group).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days.

Results

Among the 281 participants, the median age was 2.6 (interquartile range, 1.6–4.9) years (160 boys [57.7%] of 279 with sex listed). Clinical cure was observed in 101 of 114 children (88.6%) in the intervention group and in 99 of 109 (90.8%) in the control group in per-protocol analysis (risk difference, -0.016; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.087). Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days was observed in 108 of 126 (85.7%) in the intervention group and in 106 of 126 (84.1%) in the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference, 0.023; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.061).

Conclusions and Relevance

Short-course antibiotic therapy appeared to be comparable to standard care for the treatment of previously healthy children with CAP not requiring hospitalization. Clinical practice guidelines should consider recommending 5 days of amoxicillin for pediatric pneumonia management in accordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles.

### Evaluating short-course antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oxAQZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children remains uncertain. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether short-course antibiotic therapy (≤ 6 days) is associated with poor clinical outcomes compared with long-course antibiotic therapy (> 7 days) in children with CAP.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and KoreaMed. Studies comparing the efficacy and safety of short-course with long-course antibiotic regimens in children with CAP were eligible. We assessed the risk of bias using the RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools. Study characteristics such as publication year, country, setting, study design and antibiotic regimens were recorded. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for clinical outcomes, including clinical cure, treatment failure, total adverse events, serious adverse events, relapse and hospitalization. The primary outcomes were clinical cure and treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included total and serious adverse events, relapse and hospitalization rates.

Results

Seventeen studies comprising 155,944 children met the inclusion criteria, with 15 of these studies being randomized controlled trials. There were no significant differences between short-course and long-course treatments in clinical cure [21,156 patients; RR, 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97–1.05); P = 0.73; I² = 81%], treatment failure [28,942 patients; RR, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.51–1.51); P = 0.64; I² = 94%] or total adverse events [24,446 children; RR, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.61–1.44); P = 0.77; I² = 90%]. However, short-course treatment was associated with fewer serious adverse events [4194 patients; RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79–0.99); P = 0.04; I² = 11%]. Relapse rates were nominally lower with short-course treatment compared with long-course treatments (5.5% vs. 6.2%; P = 0.04). This difference was primarily observed in the subgroup analysis comparing 5-day treatments to ≥ 10-day treatments. Hospitalization rates were similar between the two groups [122,607 patients; RR, 1.20 (95% CI, 0.85–1.68); P = 0.29; I² = 0%].

Conclusions

Short-course antibiotic treatment is as effective as long-course treatment for pediatric CAP in terms of clinical cure and treatment failure while resulting in fewer serious adverse events.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^115fvY6X]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = 0.63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

### Shorter versus longer-term antibiotic treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in children: a meta-analysis [^112bYRPQ]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment of children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of shorter versus longer duration of antibiotic treatment of children with CAP.

Data Sources

We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing shorter (≤ 5 days) with longer duration antibiotic treatments in children with CAP.

Data Extraction

Paired reviewers independently extracted data and we performed random-effects meta-analyses to summarize the evidence.

Results

Sixteen trials with 12774 patients, treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics, proved eligible. There are probably no substantial differences between shorter-duration and longer-duration antibiotics in clinical cure (odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 to 1.17; risk difference [RD] 0.1%; moderate certainty), treatment failure (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; RD 0.3%; moderate certainty), and relapse (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; RD 0.5%; moderate certainty). Compared with longer-duration antibiotics, shorter-duration antibiotics do not appreciably increase mortality (RD 0.0%, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.1; high certainty), and probably have little or no impact on the need for change in antibiotics (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.47; RD 0.2%; moderate certainty), need for hospitalization (RD -0.2%, 95% CI -0.9 to 0.5; moderate certainty), and severe adverse events (RD 0.0%, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.2; moderate certainty).

Limitations

For some outcomes, evidence was lacking.

Conclusions

Duration of antibiotic therapy likely makes no important difference in patient-important outcomes. Healthcare workers should prioritize the use of shorter-duration antibiotics for children with CAP treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics.

### Childhood community-acquired pneumonia: a review of etiology-and antimicrobial treatment studies [^115CpSnP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity worldwide. Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nK74W]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The optimal treatment duration of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children has been controversial in high-income countries. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare short antibiotic treatment (3–5 days) with longer treatment (7–10 days) among children aged ≥ 6 months.

Methods

On 31 January 2022, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published in English from 2003 to 2022. We included randomized controlled trials focusing on antibiotic treatment duration in children with CAP treated as outpatients. We calculated risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals and used the fixed-effect model (low heterogeneity). Our main outcome was treatment failure, defined as need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month. Our secondary outcome was presence of antibiotic-related harms.

Results

A total of 541 studies were screened, and 4 studies with 1541 children were included in the review. Three studies had low risk of bias, and one had some concerns. All 4 studies assessed treatment failures, and the RD was 0.1% (95% confidence interval, −3.0% to 2.0%) with high quality of evidence. Two studies (1194 children) assessed adverse events related to antibiotic treatment, and the RD was 0.0% (−5.0% to 5.0%) with moderate quality of evidence. The diagnostic criteria varied between the included studies.

Conclusions

A short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was equally effective and safe compared with the longer (current) recommendation of 7–10 days in children aged ≥ 6 months with CAP. We suggest that short antibiotic courses can be implemented in treatment of pediatric CAP.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^115vKX89]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established: discrepancies exist between the different guidelines published to date. In 2007, IDSA / ATS included a minimum treatment of 5 days, provided the patient remains free of fever for 48–72 h and without more than one criterion of clinical instability. Recently published updated guidelines keep the same recommendation.

The negative impact of the overuse of antibiotics is well known. In this regard, an increase in nasopharyngeal carriers of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been observed with the use of low-dose beta-lactams for more than 5 days in children. The unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of resistance, a higher number of adverse effects, worse adherence to treatment, and a higher cost.

Several studies have been published with the aim of evaluating the safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. In a recent meta-analysis involving five clinical trials involving adults with mild-to-moderate CAP comparing the same types of antibiotic, short 3 to 7 day regimens of antibiotics were compared to 7 to 10 day regimens. The authors did not observe significant differences in terms of cure rate, mortality and adverse effects. Surprisingly, a new meta-analysis comparing ≤ 6 day versus ≥ 7 day regimens, observed a lower mortality rate in the shorter compared to the long regimen group (RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33–0.82), with similar cure and relapse rates in both groups. When evaluating only the most severe patients, mortality was 2.2% in the group with a shorter regimen compared to 4.7% in the long regimen group.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Comparative effectiveness of empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia [^111xKjKJ]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended as the first-line agent for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is little scientific evidence to support that this consensus-based recommendation is as effective as the more commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of empiric treatment with narrow-spectrum therapy versus broad-spectrum therapy for children hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective cohort study using medical records included children aged 2 months to 18 years at 4 children's hospitals in 2010 with a discharge diagnosis of CAP. Patients receiving either narrow-spectrum or broad-spectrum therapy in the first 2 days of hospitalization were eligible. Patients were matched by using propensity scores that determined each patient's likelihood of receiving empiric narrow or broad coverage. A multivariate logistic regression analysis evaluated the relationship between antibiotic and hospital length of stay (LOS), 7-day readmission, standardized daily costs, duration of fever, and duration of supplemental oxygen.

Results

Among 492 patients, 52% were empirically treated with a narrow-spectrum agent and 48% with a broad-spectrum agent. In the adjusted analysis, the narrow-spectrum group had a 10-hour shorter LOS (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in duration of oxygen, duration of fever, or readmission. When modeled for LOS, there was no difference in average daily standardized cost (P = 0.62) or average daily standardized pharmacy cost (P = 0.26).

Conclusions

Compared with broad-spectrum agents, narrow-spectrum antibiotic coverage is associated with similar outcomes. Our findings support national consensus recommendations for the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics in children hospitalized with CAP.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) outpatient antibiotic evidence — "RCTs of antibiotic treatment regimens for adults with CAP provide little evidence of either superiority or equivalence of one antibiotic regimen over another", partly due to comparators no longer available, and "We identified 16 relevant RCTs comparing two antibiotic regimens for the treatment of outpatient CAP… Meta-analyses of each of these groups of studies revealed no differences in relevant outcomes between any of the compared regimens".

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^114LjwMv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

### The association of antibiotic duration with successful treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children [^115Fxepd]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

National guidelines recommend 10 days of antibiotics for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acknowledging that the outcomes of children hospitalized with CAP who receive shorter durations of therapy have not been evaluated.

Methods

We conducted a comparative effectiveness study of children aged ≥ 6 months hospitalized at The Johns Hopkins Hospital who received short-course (5–7 days) vs prolonged-course (8–14 days) antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated CAP between 2012 and 2018 using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Inclusion was limited to children with clinical and radiographic criteria consistent with CAP, as adjudicated by 2 infectious diseases physicians. Children with tracheostomies; healthcare-associated, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated pneumonia; loculated or moderate to large pleural effusion or pulmonary abscess; intensive care unit stay > 48 hours; cystic fibrosis/bronchiectasis; severe immunosuppression; or unusual pathogens were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure, a composite of unanticipated emergency department visits, outpatient visits, hospital readmissions, or death (all determined to be likely attributable to bacterial pneumonia) within 30 days after completing antibiotic therapy.

Results

Four hundred and thirty-nine patients met eligibility criteria; 168 (38%) patients received short-course therapy (median, 6 days) and 271 (62%) received prolonged-course therapy (median, 10 days). Four percent of children experienced treatment failure, with no differences observed between patients who received short-course vs prolonged-course antibiotic therapy (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .18–1.30).

Conclusions

A short course of antibiotic therapy (approximately 5 days) does not increase the odds of 30-day treatment failure compared with longer courses for hospitalized children with uncomplicated CAP.

### Short-course versus long-course antibiotic therapy for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2 months to 59 months [^117QUtAL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age. Treatment of pneumonia requires an effective antibiotic used in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. Recommended duration of treatment ranges between 7 and 14 days, but this is not based on any empirical evidence. Shorter duration of therapy, if found to be effective, could be particularly important in resource-poor settings where there is a high risk of death, poor access to medicines and health care, and limited budgets for medicines.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy with the same antibiotic for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2 to 59 months.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (OVID) (January 1966 to September 2007); EMBASE (Embase.com) (1974 to September 2007); and LILACS (1982 to September 2007).

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy using the same antibiotic for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Three studies (5763 children) were included. Analysis of three days versus five days of treatment with the same antibiotic for non-severe pneumonia in children showed non-significant differences in rates of clinical cure at the end of treatment (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01), treatment failure at the end of treatment (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25) and relapse rate after seven days of clinical cure (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.42). Subgroup analysis evaluating the impact of different antibiotics showed non-significant differences for these outcomes with different durations of therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence of this review suggests that a short course (three days) of antibiotic therapy is as effective as a longer treatment (five days) for non-severe pneumonia in children under five years of age. However, there is a need for more well-designed RCTs to support our review findings.
