## Question

46-year-old female presents to the ER with ruptured saline, implant history of double mastectomy from breast cancer. X-ray shows a mass in the chest wall. Possibly hidden but now seen since the implant has ruptured.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 46-year-old woman with a history of bilateral mastectomy and saline implants who presents with a ruptured implant and a newly visible chest wall mass on chest X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate clinical priorities and whether this is an emergency. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies for the chest wall mass, including silicone granuloma, local recurrence, and implant-associated lymphoma. Next, I will review the optimal imaging strategy and the key radiologic signs that distinguish these entities. After that, I need to check the biopsy approach and pathologic markers that separate benign granulomas from malignancy. Finally, I will outline management pathways for each diagnosis, including surgical planning, oncologic considerations, and follow-up, while double-checking guideline concordance and potential pitfalls in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and triage. A 46-year-old with prior bilateral mastectomy and saline implants who now has a ruptured implant and a new chest wall mass on X-ray warrants urgent but not emergent evaluation. I need to ensure there is no rapidly progressive infection, hemorrhage, or airway compromise, and then proceed with a focused workup for recurrence versus implant-related complications, because saline rupture itself is not acutely dangerous though it may unmask previously hidden pathology [^117TN1oL] [^1124NqLt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about malignancy just because a new mass appears after implant rupture. The most likely explanation is a silicone granuloma from microscopic silicone bleed or shell fragments inciting a foreign-body reaction. These can present as chest wall or axillary masses and may be FDG-avid on PET/CT, mimicking recurrence, so I should keep a high index of suspicion for benign silicone-related disease while still excluding cancer [^114SAh9u] [^115H8aVX] [^1166ZyqD].

> I need to check the differential carefully. Local recurrence of breast cancer can present as a chest wall mass after mastectomy and must be excluded, particularly if the mass is irregular, vascular, or deep to the reconstruction. Ultrasound features such as vascularity, irregular shape, and deep location increase the likelihood of recurrence and should prompt biopsy rather than observation [^112Tq2A4]. But wait, what if this is breast implant–associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)? BIA-ALCL is linked to textured devices and often presents with effusion or a capsular mass; however, it is less likely here with saline implants and no reported effusion, though I should still assess for peri-implant fluid and capsular changes if clinically suspected [^112qQskT].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy. Chest X-ray is insufficient to characterize a chest wall mass; contrast-enhanced CT of the chest wall is the next best step to define size, location, relationship to ribs and muscle, and to look for calcifications, fat, or fluid components that suggest granuloma versus solid tumor, and to plan biopsy if needed [^1124NqLt] [^1173Lffg]. If CT is indeterminate or silicone granuloma is suspected, I should add breast MRI with silicone-selective sequences to evaluate for extracapsular silicone, the linguine sign, and snowstorm pattern, which are classic for rupture and silicone leak; MRI is the most sensitive modality for detecting silicone rupture and mapping silicone spread [^113z5R6p] [^114vQR16]. Ultrasound can help characterize superficial masses and guide biopsy, and PET/CT may show FDG uptake in granulomas or lymphoma, so I should use it judiciously to stage if malignancy is confirmed or strongly suspected [^1124Q6VG] [^112qQskT].

> Wait, let me verify the key imaging discriminators. A silicone granuloma often shows a soft-tissue density mass with or without calcification and may demonstrate extracapsular silicone on MRI. Ultrasound may reveal hypoechoic nodules with echogenic foci and reverberation artifacts in extracapsular silicone, while the linguine sign indicates intracapsular rupture. These findings, in the right clinical context, support a benign silicone foreign-body reaction rather than malignancy [^113z5R6p] [^116676Fg] [^114vQR16]. In contrast, local recurrence typically appears as a solid, enhancing soft-tissue mass without silicone artifacts, and BIA-ALCL may show capsular thickening, effusion, or a capsular-based mass with variable FDG avidity, so I should correlate across modalities before concluding [^112qQskT] [^113EtFhg].

> I will now examine the diagnostic confirmation pathway. If imaging cannot confidently distinguish benign from malignant disease, image-guided core needle biopsy is indicated; I need to ensure the biopsy tract is planned so it can be excised at definitive surgery, and I should request pathology to evaluate for adenocarcinoma recurrence, lymphoma, and foreign-body granulomatous reaction with multinucleated giant cells and silicone droplets, which are pathognomonic for silicone granuloma [^115Qok58] [^115TwLm4]. But wait, what if the mass abuts the implant or chest wall and is technically challenging to target? In that case, surgical excision may be both diagnostic and therapeutic, especially if malignancy is strongly suspected or the mass is enlarging [^115Qok58].

> Let me consider management if a silicone granuloma is diagnosed. Definitive treatment is surgical removal of the ruptured implant with total capsulectomy and excision of all silicone granulomas, ideally after mapping with ultrasound or MRI to minimize residual silicone. This addresses both the source of ongoing inflammation and the mass itself, with excellent local control and symptom resolution [^116RmdNv] [^112doqu4]. I should confirm that any retained silicone in nodes or distant sites is addressed if symptomatic or enlarging, recognizing that systemic siliconomas are rare but reported and may regress after source control [^112doqu4].

> If local recurrence is confirmed, I need to ensure oncologically sound management. Wide local excision with clear margins is standard, and in selected cases postoperative radiation to the chest wall may be considered to reduce the risk of another local failure, balancing prior radiation and reconstructive plans; multidisciplinary coordination with surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and plastic surgery is essential [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that imaging has excluded distant disease before proceeding with local therapy; contrast-enhanced CT or PET/CT may be warranted depending on the clinical stage and pathologic findings [^1124NqLt].

> If BIA-ALCL is diagnosed, I should confirm that management follows current standards. The cornerstone is complete surgical excision with en bloc capsulectomy and implant removal; systemic therapy and radiation are added for advanced disease with solid masses or nodal involvement, and PET/CT is recommended for staging and response assessment in invasive presentations, ideally before surgery to avoid postoperative inflammatory confounding [^112qQskT] [^115ACpKA]. I need to ensure pathology review by an expert center and consider clinical trial enrollment when available, given evolving treatment paradigms in advanced BIA-ALCL [^112qQskT].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps and timeline. Today, I would obtain a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest wall to characterize the mass and its relationships, followed by targeted ultrasound to assess for peri-implant fluid, capsular changes, and to guide potential biopsy. If CT and ultrasound are inconclusive or silicone disease is suspected, I would add non-contrast MRI with silicone-selective sequences within the next 1–2 weeks, and if imaging is suspicious for malignancy or the mass is enlarging, I would proceed to image-guided core biopsy or surgical excision within 1–2 weeks depending on local expertise and patient factors [^1124NqLt] [^1124Q6VG] [^113z5R6p] [^115Qok58]. I should double-check that the patient is counseled on the possibility of implant exchange or delayed reconstruction after definitive management of the mass, and that all implant details are documented for operative planning and device tracking [^115F95v6].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and surveillance are aligned with guidelines. After management of the mass, routine oncologic follow-up should continue per breast cancer survivorship protocols, and if silicone implants are used in any future reconstruction, I should counsel on rupture surveillance with ultrasound or MRI starting at 5–6 years and every 2–3 years thereafter, balancing ACR and FDA perspectives and individual risk, and documenting device information for ongoing care [^116U8koE] [^113tgN7X] [^114w9J9u].

The most likely cause of a new chest wall mass after saline implant rupture in a patient with prior bilateral mastectomy is **silicone granuloma** from silicone shell fragments [^115H8aVX] or a **foreign-body reaction** to implant material [^114SAh9u]. Other considerations include **local recurrence** of breast cancer [^112Tq2A4], **BIA-ALCL** [^115F95v6], and **infection** [^117TN1oL]. MRI is the best modality to define implant integrity and silicone spread [^113z5R6p]; ultrasound can guide biopsy [^1124Q6VG], and CT helps assess chest wall invasion or pulmonary involvement [^115cxLhD]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with surgical excision of the mass and capsule, and implant exchange or removal as indicated [^116RmdNv].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Silicone granuloma and foreign-body reaction

- **Silicone granuloma**: Most common after implant rupture; silicone shell fragments provoke a granulomatous reaction, forming firm, irregular masses that can mimic malignancy [^115H8aVX] [^112doqu4].

- **Foreign-body reaction**: Non-silicone implant materials (saline, polymers) can incite chronic inflammation and granuloma formation [^115TwLm4].

- **Imaging features**: Ultrasound shows hyperechoic "snowstorm" or "stepladder" signs from silicone globules; MRI shows low-signal silicone with surrounding inflammatory tissue [^116676Fg] [^113z5R6p].

---

### Local recurrence of breast cancer

Local recurrence presents as a **firm, irregular mass** at the mastectomy site or along the chest wall and may be obscured by implants until rupture reveals it [^116k5NjQ]. Imaging typically shows a solid, enhancing mass on MRI or CT, with ultrasound features of irregular shape, deep location, and internal vascularity [^112Tq2A4] [^115cxLhD].

---

### Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)

BIA-ALCL is a rare T-cell lymphoma linked to textured implants, presenting with **peri-implant effusion**, capsular masses, or chest wall invasion [^113EtFhg]. Imaging may show a peri-implant effusion, capsular thickening or mass, and regional lymphadenopathy; PET/CT can stage disease [^112qQskT].

---

### Infection and inflammatory complications

Infection may present with **erythema, warmth, pain, and purulent discharge**; chronic infection can form abscesses or draining sinuses [^notfound]. Imaging may reveal a fluid collection, abscess, or thickened capsule; ultrasound can guide aspiration for culture [^1124Q6VG].

---

## Diagnostic imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Role in diagnosis** | **Findings suggestive of silicone granuloma** | **Findings suggestive of malignancy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | First-line for superficial masses; guides biopsy | - Hyperechoic silicone globules ("snowstorm" sign) <br/> - "Stepladder" sign [^116676Fg] | - Irregular, vascular solid mass <br/> - Deep location [^112Tq2A4] |
| MRI | Gold standard for implant integrity and silicone mapping | - Low-signal silicone droplets <br/> - Surrounding inflammatory tissue [^112sxUtm] | - Solid enhancing mass <br/> - Invasion of chest wall [^notfound] |
| CT | Assesses chest wall invasion, pulmonary involvement, and osseous destruction | - Calcified granulomas <br/> - Soft-tissue silicone masses [^notfound] | - Destructive mass <br/> - Bone invasion <br/> - Lymphadenopathy [^115cxLhD] |
| PET/CT | Evaluates metabolic activity; differentiates inflammation from malignancy | Mild FDG uptake in granulomas [^notfound] | - Marked FDG uptake in malignancy <br/> - Lymph node involvement [^112qQskT] |

## Clinical management

### Surgical management

- **Explantation and capsulectomy**: Remove implant and capsule; excise silicone granulomas or masses [^116RmdNv].

- **Implant exchange**: Consider after clearance of granulomas and negative pathology.

- **Chest wall resection**: For invasive malignancy or extensive granulomatous disease [^111eavrj].

---

### Medical management

Medical management includes **antibiotics** for infection and **oncologic therapy** — chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy — for confirmed malignancy [^115F95v6].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent** for silicone granuloma after complete excision, whereas malignancy carries a guarded prognosis that depends on stage and treatment response [^116k5NjQ]. Complications can include chronic pain, recurrent granulomas, infection, and, rarely, chronic silicone pneumonitis from distant silicone embolization [^114iJtEL].

---

The most likely cause of a new chest wall mass after saline implant rupture is a **silicone granuloma** or foreign-body reaction; however, recurrence and BIA-ALCL must be excluded. MRI best defines silicone spread and implant integrity; ultrasound guides biopsy, and CT assesses chest wall or pulmonary involvement. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with surgical excision and implant management tailored to pathology and extent.

Q2. What is BIA-ALCL. Is BIA-ALCL breast cancer. An individual's risk of developing BIA-ALCL is considered to be low; however, this cancer is serious and can lead to death, especially if not treated promptly. In most patients, it is treated successfully with surgery to remove the implant and surrounding scar tissue, and in some patients, also treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Upon evaluation by a health care provider, evidence of fluid collection around the breast implant is often observed. Some patient reports indicated that a lump under the skin or capsular contracture were present. Q4. Where in the breast has BIA-ALCL been found. A4. In the case studies reported in the literature, BIA-ALCL is usually found near the breast implant, contained within the fibrous scar capsule, and not in the breast tissue itself. The illustration below shows the location of the ALCL in these reports.

In most cases, the ALCL cells were found in the fluid surrounding the implant or contained within the fibrous scar capsule. Q6. Could certain textured tissue expanders increase the risk of BIA-ALCL. Q7. Does the fill of the breast implant–silicone versus saline–increase an individual's risk of developing BIA-ALCL. A7. Based on the currently available data, the type of implant fill does not appear to be a risk factor for BIA-ALCL, but this has not been evaluated in a large, well-designed, epidemiologic study. To date, there has not been sufficient data to determine whether ALCL may be found more or less frequently in individuals with silicone-filled breast implants compared to individuals with saline-filled breast implants.
- Patients with confirmed BIA-ALCL should undergo implant removal with removal of the surrounding scar capsule, which is a more extensive operation than implant removal alone.
- As with any implanted device, it is good to keep a record of the device manufacturer and implant model name. You may have received this information on a patient device card from your surgeon. If you would like to obtain the manufacturer name and model of your implants, consider asking your surgeon or obtaining the record of your surgery from the facility where it was performed.

### Secondary breast augmentation: managing each case [^116Jvd2V]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

For cases in which the implant is fitted into a submuscular pocket, total or partial capsulectomy should be performed. The part of the capsule that remains adhering to the costal rib wall should be retained, with a new implant fitted into it.

Closed capsulectomy should be avoided because the immediate effect it creates is of short duration. It produces bleeding by breaking the tissues and can increase the capsula thickness as a result of hematoma, irregularities in palpation, rupture of the implant, and pain. On the other hand, with open capsulectomy, small amounts of silicone, talc, and other substances are eliminated. The tissues are left free for their appropriate distribution, thus avoiding irregularities or retractions.

A suspected rupture of a silicone gel implant affected women's attitudes about the implant types they would consider if getting implants for the first time today. Those who had a suspected rupture were less likely to consider a silicone gel implant today (73.0 percent) and more likely to consider no implant (17.4 percent) than those women who did not have a suspected rupture (80.8 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively). Women who had a suspected rupture and those who did not have a suspected rupture were about equally likely to consider a saline-filled implant type if getting implants for the first time today (33.9 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively).

### Understanding breast implant illness, before and after explantation: a patient-reported outcomes study [^116RmdNv]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

All patients were treated using a standardized surgical technique of total capsulectomy and implant removal further referred to as explantation in this manuscript. Capsule on the chest wall was routinely removed to the maximum extent possible; this included both anterior and posterior capsules of the implant. For patients with multiple sets of implants with capsules located in both subglandular and submuscular planes, both current and previous capsules were removed. For patients with extracapsular rupture, all silicone granuloma were removed following mapping by ultrasound examination by a radiologist experienced in detecting silicone granuloma. Partial capsulectomy was not performed on any of the study patients.

Patient demographics are reported in a descriptive, deidentified fashion to evaluate characteristics of patients who underwent removal of breast implants. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide, Version 7.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Repeated-measures analysis of variance accounting for dependency were used to compare preoperative and postoperative survey scores at less than 30 days and greater than 30 days postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate associations of various clinical, demographic and implant-related factors were assessed using linear regression models for their impact on change in survey scores. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma — diagnostic pathology — features tumor cells with large anaplastic morphology on cytology that uniformly express CD30 and variably pan-T-cell markers but not ALK and represent a monoclonal T-cell population, and histopathologic findings need to be correlated with a clinical presentation and history of a breast implant to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Cytologic diagnosis from effusions requires a sufficient volume of fluid (minimum, 50 mL) to achieve diagnosis, prior serial aspirations may decrease or dilute tumor burden and make diagnosis more challenging; therefore, pathology review of the first aspiration is advisable. Multiple systematic samplings of scar capsulectomy specimen may be necessary to determine early invasive disease and mass formation, which have implications for prognosis, and secondary review by a tertiary referral center is recommended for equivocal pathology.

### Squamous cell carcinoma arising in breast implant capsules [^114FMaLP]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Breast augmentation and reconstruction utilizing implants are among the most common plastic surgery procedures performed in the United States. A small proportion of these implants are removed each year. We report 2 cases where routine pathologic evaluation of capsulectomy specimens revealed squamous cell carcinoma associated with the breast implant capsule and discuss the possible pathogenesis of this unusual entity. Both patients had long-standing implants (> 10 years) and presented with acute unilateral breast erythema and swelling. Intraoperatively, the capsules for both cases appeared thickened and calcified, containing extensive granulomatosis and keratinaceous debris invading into the chest wall. Extensive workup failed to find an occult primary. One patient died from a malignant pleural effusion secondary to tumor invasion during chemotherapy, and the second patient obtained stabilization of the mass after 5 weeks of chemotherapy but subsequently declined further surgical intervention. A thorough literature review was performed, and 5 similar reports were identified, involving 6 patients. All patients presented with similar clinical presentations as ours and had poor outcomes. The mean reporting age at diagnosis was 60 years, and the average time from initial implant to diagnosis was 25 years. Due to the small numbers of squamous cell carcinomas associated with breast implant capsules, the true association between the 2 is unknown. It is postulated that chronic inflammation/irritation from the breast implant and epithelialization of the capsule play a significant role in the disease process. This may represent a new entity of "chronic inflammatory capsular malignancies". Increased awareness of this entity may allow for earlier suspicion, diagnosis, and management.

F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has proved clinically useful for both malignant and inflammatory lesions. The author describes a 54-year-old woman with previously treated carcinoma of the breast. There was spontaneous rupture of a breast implant placed previously as part of a reconstruction. While being evaluated clinically, prominent axillary lymph nodes were palpated on the ipsilateral side of the recent implant rupture. An F-18 FDG PET scan demonstrated intense uptake in these nodes. Lymph node biopsy demonstrated benign inflammatory reaction and no recurrence of malignancy.

Patients with breast implants

Breast US is usually the first line examination performed in women with implants to investigate breast implant complications that may present with pain, lumps, or asymmetries. It can be used to detect alterations of the implant structure, typically subdivided into intracapsular ruptures (when the implant envelope is broken but the silicon remains inside the capsule) and extracapsular ruptures (when the silicone leaks out of the broken capsule). Of note, the fibrotic capsule around the implant develops through a natural foreign body reaction of the breast tissues to the implant.

Considering breast implant integrity, US is a very specific, although not very sensitive, method: if an implant rupture is suspected on US, the probability of a true rupture is high; conversely, if no rupture is visible on US, a rupture (mostly intra-capsular) is still possible. In addition, US is useful in diagnosing other implant complication such as infection, seroma, or granuloma. MRI is the usual second step after US in this setting, especially for detecting intracapsular ruptures unnoticed with US.

There are no contraindications to performing US-guided interventions (biopsy, preoperative localisation) in women with breast implants.
Note F. If you have breast implants, for either aesthetic reasons or from oncoplastic surgery, and a breast examination is planned (including US), please give the radiologist a complete information about the type of your breast implant, if this information is available to you. There are many implant types (e.g. double or single lumen, silicone-only or silicone and saline solution, etc.) and the diagnostic performance is increased when the radiologist is aware of the type of implant you have.

Intraoperative US lesion identification and US of specimens

Although it is not commonly used in clinical practice, some experiences have been reported about the use of US for perioperative lesion identification in breast conserving surgery, with the aim of better margin management. Ultrasound of the surgical specimen may be used for evaluating the presence of the lesion and resection margin status, especially in the case of non-palpable lesions not associated with calcifications or not identifiable at mammography.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of breast augmentation: a pictorial review [^114vQR16]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Normal appearance

In a normal implant, the shell is intact with a surrounding thin, fibrous capsule. It is common to find a small to moderate amount of peri-prosthetic fluid, which is reactive in nature (Fig. 5). The presence of radial folds is normal. They are perpendicular infoldings of the shell into the silicone gel or saline solution, extending inwards from the periphery (Fig. 6). This can be mistaken as implant rupture by the inexperienced eye.

### RE: prosthetic breast implant rupture: imaging-pictorial essay: full cooperation between surgeon and radiologist: "The best of both worlds" [^112fiYyi]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Cooperation between plastic surgeons and radiologists is fundamental when breast prosthesis rupture is suspected. We describe our experience managing the case of suspected implant rupture in a patient that underwent CT scan imaging for thoracic pain. Poor clinical information given to radiologists leads to wrong diagnosis: during surgery, both prostheses were checked revealing no signs of rupture. Full communication among different specialists involved in the multidisciplinary approach is always recommended, and an easy-to-use national breast implant register would allow a better management of patients' follow-up and eventual preoperative planning.

### Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma with invasive chest wall masses [^111eavrj]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) might occur in any patient with a history of textured breast devices, and often presents as a spectrum of disease: from a simple late-onset seroma, to complex advanced locally aggressive disease with chest wall involvement. The combination of medical therapy and surgical implant removal with complete capsulectomy is believed to be curative.

Objectives

In patients with advanced cases, however, and although generalized recommendations exist, no consensus exists regarding the ideal medical and surgical management of those presenting with invasive disease.

Methods

This preliminary report describes 2 distinct presentations of rare invasive chest wall BIA-ALCL, both treated successfully, by using a combined medical and surgical multidisciplinary team approach. Subsequently, we discuss considerations and the current literature surrounding the treatment of advanced BIA-ALCL with chest wall and adjacent structure involvement.

Results

All patients necessitated chest wall resection and composite reconstruction due to tumor involvement of the thorax with residual hypermetabolic activity, despite chemotherapeutic pretreatment with different neoadjuvant medical therapies. All healed well after surgery and experienced resolution of symptoms without signs of relapse on regular follow-up.

Conclusions

In the rare subset of patients presenting with invasive BIA-ALCL, the question persists as to which systemic treatment remains optimal. However, the evidence supports multiple, particularly in combination with surgical extirpation and reconstruction. Here we present 2 proven treatments, both in timing and modalities chosen, as part of the first step to establish a formally accepted treatment paradigm for advanced BIA-ALCL patients with invasive chest wall involvement.

### Ultrasound may help detect chest wall recurrence after mastectomy at an early stage [^112Tq2A4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To define ultrasound (US) features that help diagnose local recurrence (LR) and differentiate benign masses from LR chest wall masses after mastectomy in patients with breast cancer.

Methods

The US and surgical records of 119 pathologically confirmed chest wall masses in 101 patients were reviewed from 4634 patients with breast cancer who underwent mastectomies. The chest wall masses were divided into 2 groups depending on their longitudinal diameter (LD; ≤ 10 and > 10mm). The US features of the subgroups, depending on their nature (benign and LR), were analyzed and compared.

Results

Among 119 masses, 58 (48.74%) were benign masses, and 61 (51.26%) were LR masses. For LR, the mean area under the curve ± SD, sensitivity, and specificity of US were 0.849 ± 0.033, 85.25%, and 84.48% (P < .001), respectively. Among the US characteristics, vascularity, an irregular shape, and a location in deep layers were the top 3 factors related to LR (odds ratios, 4.0, 2.6, and 2.2). To diagnose LR by US, judging the anatomic layer of the locations of masses with an LD of 10mm or less and the presence of vascularity in masses with an LD of greater than 10mm were helpful.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is a relatively accurate and objective method to differentiate LR from a benign mass after mastectomy with follow-up. Judging the anatomic layer of the mass location with US likely increases the accuracy of LR diagnosis at an early stage.

### A case report of prefilled polysaccharide hydrogel breast implant rupture: clinical, MRI, and pathologic findings [^1138AnLZ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

A case of a ruptured prefilled polysaccharide hydrogel breast implant with its radiologic and pathologic findings is presented. Usually, hydrogel spreads out in tissues with swelling and edema after rupture of an implant. However, in this case, a small amount of hydrogel leakage was misdiagnosed with ultrasonography as a benign breast mass. Therefore, it is advisable to evaluate a breast mass after augmentation with a hydrogel breast implant using magnetic resonance imaging to differentiate it from the hydrogel itself.

### Correction of postpneumonectomy syndrome using a custom implant [^114eqnv1]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors describe a patient who underwent a right pneumonectomy for removal of a bronchial carcinoid tumour. Over time she developed recurrent infections, dyspnoea and wheeze despite no evidence of tumour recurrence. A marked mediastinal shift caused severe narrowing of the left main-stem bronchus as it was draped over the vertebral column consistent with a diagnosis of postpneumonectomy syndrome. Mediastinal reorientation was accomplished with the placement of two breast implants. Failure of the superior implant resulted in a recurrence of symptoms 4 months postoperatively. A durable custom expander with wall thickness three times that of a standard expander was placed after rupture of one of the two initially placed saline implants. At 2-years follow-up the patient has complete resolution of symptoms, without any further postoperative complications.

### Breast implants: common questions and answers [^114w9J9u]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast implants are used for a wide range of cosmetic and reconstructive purposes. In addition to breast augmentation, implants can be used for postmastectomy breast reconstruction, correction of congenital breast anomalies, breast or chest wall deformities, and male-to-female top surgery. Breast implants may confer significant benefits to patients, but several factors are important to consider preoperatively, including the impact on mammography, future lactation, and potential long-term implant complications (e.g., infection, capsular contracture, rupture, and the need for revision, replacement, or removal). A fundamental understanding of implant monitoring is also paramount to implant use. Patients with silicone breast implants should undergo routine screening for implant rupture with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography completed five to six years postoperatively and then every two to three years thereafter. With the exception of complications, there are no formal recommendations regarding the timing of breast implant removal or exchange. Women with unilateral breast swelling should be evaluated with ultrasonography for an effusion that might indicate breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. There are no specific breast cancer screening recommendations for patients with breast implants, but special mammographic views are indicated to enhance accuracy. Although these discussions are a routine component of consultation and postoperative follow-up for plastic surgeons performing these procedures, family physicians should have a working knowledge of implant indications, characteristics, and complications to better counsel their patients, to ensure appropriate screening, and to coordinate care after surgery.

In conclusion, while silicone breast augmentation is one of the most popular aesthetic surgical procedures globally, they are not guaranteed to last a lifetime. Implant quality has improved significantly owing to advances in manufacturing, thereby reducing the risk of capsule formation and implant rupture. The rupture of silicone implants is often insidious, but it can lead to problems at any time. Therefore, it is important to educate patients on the need for close monitoring of their implants after augmentation through MRI or an ultrasound scan to facilitate early detection of any changes before a rupture occurs. Early detection of the implant rupture, in turn, will facilitate early and effective management.

Unlabelled

This article discusses eleven cases of implant ruptures in nine patients that occurred 3–10 years after primary surgery. The implant ruptures were diagnosed by visual inspection, palpation, ultrasound and MRI of the breast. We describe rupture symptoms and treatment tactics depending on the characteristics of the rupture, the nature of the filler (liquid silicone, soft cohesive gel (Soft Touch™) or high cohesive silicone gel), the current condition of the soft tissues and presence of any complications. We present recommendations allowing early detection of an asymptomatic rupture.

### Breast fibromatosis response to tamoxifen: dynamic MRI findings and review of the current treatment options [^1172jtuK]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Breast fibromatosis is a rare entity responsible for 0.2% of all solid breast tumors. It has been associated with scars, pregnancy, implants, and familial adenomatous polyposis. We present an interesting case of breast fibromatosis in a 29 year old woman which encroached upon her saline implant and subsequently filled its cavity once the implant was removed. The patient was put on tamoxifen therapy and at 14 month follow-up there was a significant decrease in the size of the mass. Dynamic MRI images are offered for review and current treatment options are discussed.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^115TwLm4]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies and traumatic causes

Foreign body granuloma arises from reaction to any foreign materials that cannot be broken down, such as silicone, suture material, wood, gunpowder, plastic sewing needle and paraffin. Alternatively, traumatic granulomas originate from any procedure or injury resulting in fat necrosis. The granulomas that form around fat necrosis are the result of difficulty removing the necrotic fat because of its large size.

Silicone

Silicone for breast augmentation was initially injected directly into the breast. This procedure was performed in the United States until it was prohibited in the 1970s because of reports of lymphadenopathy, infection, granulomatous masses and fibrosis.

Silicone implants were introduced in the 1960s with the theory that the barrier shell would reduce the complications of direct silicone injection. Unfortunately, the shells used in these early implants were semi-porous and allowed small amounts of silicone gel to "bleed" without implant rupture. These early implants were also prone to rupture with increasing age, and when they rupture result in large amounts of extracapsular silicone. The complications of this free silicone were indistinguishable from those of direct silicone injection.

Clinical

Patients may present with pain, soreness or swelling in the affected breast, change in breast size or shape, lumps in the affected breast or softening or hardening of the affected breast. Silicone granulomas may present distant from the implant site; primarily, the ipsilateral chest wall and axillary lymph nodes are involved. Ductal extension, with silicone being discharged from the nipple, and pectoralis muscle extension have also been reported.

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^116st4L2]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

A woman in her mid-70s presented with worsening dyspnoea, cough and fatigue initially treated for pneumonia. Despite antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, prompting further investigation. Medical history included previous breast implants, the latter of which had ruptured years earlier and was subsequently removed prior to the current presentation. Imaging revealed bilateral lung consolidations and lymphadenopathy. Bronchoalveolar lavage indicated macrophagic alveolitis, while biopsies showed chronic inflammation and the presence of silicone. Diagnosis of chronic pulmonary silicone embolism was made, a rare condition linked to the migration of silicone particles into the lungs, causing inflammation. Treatment involved corticosteroids, leading to symptom resolution. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of silicone pneumonitis, which can manifest years after implant rupture and removal. Clinicians should be aware of this condition to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, as symptoms may persist even after implant removal due to irreversible lung fibrosis.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^116U8koE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the cost-prohibitive nature of MRI imaging, some have proposed using alternatives such as mammography or ultrasound. Mammography has limited sensitivity in detecting gel implant ruptures, estimated at approximately 20%, due to the homogenous presentation of silicone gel on X-ray imaging. Ultrasound does not have as high of a sensitivity for implant rupture compared with MRI, with detection estimates in the 60% range, but it is significantly more cost effective.– Rietjens et al.found that ultrasound had a negative predictive value of 85%, therefore if the ultrasound findings are negative, MRI may not be necessary. They proposed screening asymptomatic women with ultrasound every year and with MRI every 5 years.

In 2020, the FDA changed their recommendations for asymptomatic silicone implant rupture to include ultrasound or MRI starting 5–6 years after initial surgery and every 2–3 years thereafter. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) refers to these FDA guidelines on their own website. Of note, the FDA does not currently have recommendations regarding saline implants, although saline implant rupture is nearly always clinically detectable due to the design of the implant. The American College of Radiology (ACR) most recently issued guidelines in 2018 regarding breast implant evaluation. In contrast to the FDA, the ACR stated that there was no clear role for imaging of saline implants or silicone implants in asymptomatic patients, based on meta-analyses with level 1 evidence. Clinical suspicion for rupture in patients with saline implants is best evaluated with ultrasound, with no role for MRI in the evaluation of saline implants. For suspected abnormalities in patients with silicone implants, the ACR guidelines recommend imaging with ultrasound or non-contrast MRI if there are suspected implant complications. In contrast to both the FDA and ACR guidelines, the British Society of Breast Radiology, Association of Breast Surgery Great Britain & Ireland, and the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons also recommend against routine imaging in asymptomatic patients. They recommend that ultrasound should be the first-line modality for any implant concerns, with subsequent MRI follow-up if the ultrasound is equivocal or if there are persistent clinical concerns despite normal ultrasound imaging. These findings are summarized and compared in Table 2.

### Rupture of 40-year-old silicone gel breast implants: a case report [^114pdTKg]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 70-year-old female patient presented with a lump in the upper and inner quadrants (UIQ) of the right breast. It was a painless mass associated with an erythematous skin change of approximately 3 cm and progressive enlargement (Fig. 1). She had undergone silicone gel-filled augmented mammoplasty at a private hospital in Taipei 40 years ago without any complications. After the augmentation, she did not undergo regular follow-ups for her breast implants. She had no medical or family history of breast cancer that would significantly affect her implants and no injury involving the chest area, and she had not received a breast massage. Physical examination revealed bilateral hardened breasts and palpable and visible implants. These signs and symptoms were consistent with capsular contractures corresponding to grade IV on the Baker scale. Breast sonography (Fig. 2 a) revealed scattered hypoechoic nodules with sizes of < 5 mm in both breasts. Owing to the breast implants, fine-needle aspiration cytology was not attempted. Breast MRI (Fig. 2 b, c) findings revealed silicone leakage around the right implant with focal fibrosis and a bulging configuration in the UIQ of the right breast. Concerned regarding the possible side effects of the silicone, the patient requested the implant to be removed without any replacement.

### Siliconomas mimicking cancer [^1166ZyqD]. Clinical Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Silicone breast implants are widely used for breast augmentation and breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Implant rupture has specific radiological signs. With the advent use of new imaging technique such as positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast, these signs may simulate malignancy.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed four cases of patients with silicon breast implants who arrive to the mammography clinic for further evaluation of a suspected malignant process demonstrated on either PET CT or breast MRI.

Results

Two cases were of PET CT performed for routine oncology follow-up of breast cancer. On both, the PET CT demonstrated multiple-spread benign silicone granulomas manifesting as multiple masses having an increase fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. One case of a new mass was demonstrated as a suspicious mass on the dynamic sequences on MRI of the breast. Ultrasound-guided biopsy demonstrated benign tissue response to silicone. One case demonstrated bilateral ruptured breast implants on breast MRI, as well as bilateral axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Eventually, the patient underwent bronchoscopy for pulmonary workup of dry cough, revealing sarcoidosis.

Conclusion

Silicone granulomas can manifest as masses with suspicious morphology and enhancement dynamics on breast MRI or with increased FDG uptake on PET CT. The presence of silicone implants and awareness of the possibility of a rupture and formation of silicone granulomas may help in facilitating a correct diagnosis.

### Guidelines for using breast magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate implant integrity [^114CnhUG]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this report was to review our experience with using breast magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate breast implant integrity and to offer a decision tree to assist physicians in managing these patients. Data were available for 81 patients with 146 implants placed either unilaterally or bilaterally for either cosmesis or breast reconstruction. The chief complaint for a majority of patients (n = 24) was breast pain. Thirty-two patients were found to have 44 ruptured implants, the majority of whom were found to have either contracture (n = 7) or negative findings (n = 7) on physician examination. The likelihood of rupture increased with number of years in place. When a patient presents for a possible implant rupture, the initial concern is to rule out malignancy, but because clinical and radiologic findings are often convoluted and complicated, a decision tree is helpful.

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^114iJtEL]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We present the case of a patient with subacute, worsening dyspnoea, inflammatory syndrome associated with radiologically progressive multifocal pneumonitis leading to respiratory failure, several years after a documented rupture of a breast prosthesis and its removal before the onset of symptoms. To our knowledge, only seven cases of pathologically confirmed pneumonitis due to CPSE have been reported.

In USA, it is estimated that 1% of women have breast implants, which represents 3.5 million people. It is the second most frequently performed plastic and reconstructive surgery procedure, and it is estimated that 2.2 million breast augmentations were performed worldwide in 2023. Silicone implants are widely used for cosmetic and reconstructive purposes because of the presumed benign nature of the substance and its lack of immunogenicity. Safety of silicone implants became a concern after the first case of silicone pneumonitis reported in 1976. Concerns about their safety are rising as the prevalence of all-type complications (auto-immune diseases, hypersensitivity reactions, granulomas, lymphadenopathy) is approximately 20%, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The actual incidence of pulmonary silicone pneumonitis is unknown. The main pulmonary vascular complication is acute or chronic pulmonary silicone particles embolization.

The majority of pulmonary complications associated with silicone injection are due to acute pulmonary silicone embolism. This rare but well-known entity occurs within 72 hours of the injection of subcutaneous liquid silicone, which is currently prohibited by the FDA.

CPSE is even rarer and occurs years after implants' insertion, most often in patients with a history of prosthetic rupture, as in our patient's case. The prevalence of CPSE in women with breast augmentation is unknown. These pulmonary complications are a real diagnostic challenge since the clinical and radiological manifestations occur years after initial implantation and diagnosis is often delayed. The clinical presentation (dyspnoea, cough and possibly fever) is not specific. In most cases, infectious pneumonia is first suspected, and silicone pneumonitis is later considered after several courses of antibiotics and multiple investigations. Imaging often reveals diffuse ground-glass opacities with condensations, also opening the way to a broad differential diagnosis, including infections and organising pneumonia. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of silicone surrounded by inflammation on lung biopsy.

Breast implants — MRI screening guidance — states that the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) does not recommend routine MRI screening in asymptomatic patients with silicone or saline implants, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006) recommended serial MRI screening to detect rupture; because a systematic review and meta-analysis identified methodologic biases resulting in overestimation of MRI benefit, the FDA recommendations should be interpreted with caution regarding routine screening of patients with silicone implants.

### The breast imager's approach to nonmammary masses at breast and axillary US: imaging technique, clues to origin, and management [^111etCzP]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) of the breast and axilla is primarily used to evaluate a symptomatic patient or to further investigate findings identified with other imaging modalities. Breast imagers are generally familiar with US evaluation of level I, II, and III axillary lymph nodes in the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. However, the axilla contains nonlymphatic tissue as well, including muscle, fat, and vascular and neurologic structures, and anatomically the breast lies on the chest wall. Therefore, lesions of nonmammary and non-lymph node origin in the axilla or chest wall are not infrequently encountered during US evaluation of the breast or axilla. In fact, such lesions may be the reason that the patient presents to the breast imaging department for evaluation. Understanding the anatomy of the chest wall and axilla and using a systematic US approach will help radiologists expedite accurate diagnosis, suggest optimal additional imaging, and streamline appropriate clinical referral. Key imaging features of nonmammary non-lymph node masses are highlighted, and case examples are provided to illustrate these features. Appropriate patient management is critical in these cases because referral to a breast surgeon may not be the best next step. Depending on institutional referral patterns, other subspecialty surgeons will be involved. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Question 2: Which immunohistochemical stain is most useful in identifying this lesion?
A. Desmin
B. S100 protein
C. EMA
D. CD-117
E. CD31
Answers:
A. Desmin – Incorrect. Desmin is a useful stain in identifying smooth muscle tumors as it confirms myogenic origin of tissues. It is not helpful in angiosarcoma diagnosis.
B. S100 protein – Incorrect. S100 is a useful marker in neural tissue and melanoma. The absence of S100 may aid the diagnosis of angiosarcoma if melanoma is a consideration.
C. EMA – Incorrect. Epithelial membrane antigen is a marker for adenocarcinomas and meningiomas rather than vascular tumors.
D. CD-117 – Incorrect. CD-117 or proto-oncogene c- Kit, is helpful in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors but not in angiosarcoma.
E. CD31 – Correct. Immunohistochemical markers are important in the diagnosis of angiosarcomas; they typically express CD31, CD34, von Willebrand factor, Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor.CD31 is especially useful, as it is both highly sensitive and specific; it is particularly useful in poorly differentiated angiosarcomas.

Question 3: Which of the following is not a risk factor for this condition?
A. Human herpes virus 8
B. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome
C. Radiation therapy
D. Post–breast cancer treatment
E. Milroy disease
Answers:
A. Human herpes virus 8 – Correct. Human herpes virus 8 does not have an established association with angiosarcoma.
B. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome – Incorrect. Although most cases of angiosarcoma are thought to arise spontaneously, predisposing factors are well described. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital condition that affects the development of blood vessels, lymphatics, and soft tissues — associated chronic lymphedema predisposes to the development of angiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome).
C. Radiation therapy – Incorrect. Radiotherapy is an independent risk factor for angiosarcoma development, and the association is not exclusive to treatment of the breast.
D. Post–breast cancer treatment – Incorrect. Chronic lymphedema associated with breast cancer treatment is a risk factor for angiosarcoma as is chronic lymphedema of any aetiology.
E. Milroy disease – Incorrect. Milroy disease, a congenital condition that causes impaired lymphatic function, is another example of chronic lymphedema that predisposes to angiosarcoma development.

Intracapsular mass

An intracapsular mass usually has a high heterogeneous signal in T2-weighted sequences and hyposignal in T1-weighted sequences. It is a slow-growing mass that has a compressive effect on the breast implant. Its main differential diagnosis is intracapsular haematoma, which makes the use of intravenous contrast essential (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5).

### Subpectoral and precapsular implant repositioning technique: correction of capsular contracture and implant malposition [^1114NanF]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The technique presented in this report makes it possible to easily dissect and create conditions similar to total capsulectomy in a novel, scar tissue-free environment. Without disturbing the posterior aspect of the capsule adjoining the chest wall, the anterior surface of the capsule was dissected away from the pectoralis major muscle and a new space was created behind the muscle and anterior to the capsule; a new pocket was created so that an implant may be placed there. In cases of infected capsule, calcified capsule, or ruptured capsule where silicone gel was released, it is undesirable to retain the capsule. In these circumstances, a total capsulectomy is preferable.

As described, postoperative recurrence of capsular contractures can be reduced with this technique because the implant does not come in contact with the inner surface of the capsule. Moreover, the shape and size of the new pocket can be formed as desired by the patient, similar to the initial operation. However, there is some controversy regarding how the retained capsule may change over time. Hardt et al. reported that retained implant capsules may evolve to take several forms, including a speculated mass similar to a breast carcinoma, dense calcifications that obscure the neighboring breast tissue on imaging studies, or a cystic mass due to persistent serous effusion, expansile hematoma, or encapsulated silicone-filled cysts. However, Rockwell et al. described retained capsules that were still present after silicone gel implant removal. Cihat et al. reported that retained capsules would most likely disappear in time if the capsule is not stimulated by the implant. We also believe that retained capsules will be resorbed or thinned over time. Consequently, we need more long-term follow-up studies with radiological and histological surveys.

Leukotriene antagonists are known to effectively prevent capsular contractures. Zafirlukast (Accolate ®, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) was prescribed to all patients postoperatively since October 2002, except for patients with hepatic dysfunction (due to its association with hepatic failure). No signs of hepatotoxic effects were observed following the leukotriene antagonist therapy.

### A novel technique for teaching challenging ultrasound-guided breast procedures to radiology residents [^111poi3i]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasound-guided breast interventions (core biopsies, needle-wire localizations, and fine-needle cyst aspirations) are common procedures performed by radiologists. Residents must gain competency in these interventions during training. Phantoms and simulations have been advocated for teaching interventions, and various systems are available for standard breast interventions. However, simulations for difficult/high-risk interventions are not readily available. We describe an inexpensive method for simulating difficult ultrasound-guided breast procedures, including masses over breast implants, deep masses along the chest wall, and lymph nodes adjacent to axillary vessels.

### Rupture of 40-year-old silicone gel breast implants: a case report [^113z5R6p]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of implant rupture

One study showed that rupture of silicone implants occurred 12 years after implantation on average. The degree of silicone implant rupture can be classified into 3 types: intracapsular, extracapsular or leakage. Intracapsular rupture refers to the silicone still confined within the fibrous capsule enveloping the implant. Extracapsular rupture takes place when visible silicone material is present outside the fibrous capsule that surrounds the implant. While leakage refers to silicone material permeating through the intact shell of the implant. When a saline implant ruptures, the breast deflates, and salt water is absorbed by the body. In contrast, the detection of silicone implant rupture can be time consuming. The gel is not absorbed; thus, it spreads to the adjacent lymph nodes and lungs, forming granulomas in the arm, chest, or any other part of the body. Various diagnostic tools for implant rupture are available, including MRI, ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography, and physical examination. The latter is unreliable because it only has a sensitivity of 30%. In contrast, MRI is ideal for detecting implant rupture, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 54% for detecting rupture or leakage. The 'linguine sign' has been reported to have a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 65% in breakage detection. In comparison, ultrasound had a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 92%, and an accuracy of 77% in breakage detection. FDA recommends MRI or ultrasound of silicone gel implants at 5–6 years after implantation and every 2–3 years to screen for silent rupture.

In our case, ultrasonography showed the stepladder and snowstorm signs (Fig. 2 a), which indicated intracapsular and extracapsular rupture, respectively. In addition, the 'linguine sign' was present on breast MRI (Fig. 2 b) findings, which revealed an intracapsular rupture of both breasts.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^113oj3fv]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Tumours of the mediastinum represent a wide diversity of disease state. The location and composition of a mass is critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of mediastinal masses can range from being asymptomatic to producing compressive symptoms. Although many of these masses have similar imaging appearances, clinical history, anatomical position and certain details seen at CT and MRI imaging allow correct diagnosis in many cases.

### Chronic pulmonary silicone embolism after breast implant rupture: an underdiagnosed cause of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia? [^113y5r1G]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Treatment, outcome and follow-up

The catamnesis revealed that the left breast implant, which had been replaced 20 years ago, ruptured during a cardiac massage because of acute myocardial infarction 10 years before removal. Two breast MRI studies that had been performed before removal revealed an intracapsular rupture of the left retro-pectoral breast prosthesis associated with axillary and intramammary adenopathy. A breast MRI carried out just before removal had shown multiple left axillary lymph node silicomas associated with the previous rupture. Thus, the patient had been wearing the ruptured left breast implant for 5 years before it was replaced and finally removed 1 year before actual presentation. The pre-sternal implant shows no signs of rupture. She had no history of silicone injections and no other significant past exposure.

The patient was started on prednisone (1 mg/kg). The oxygen was rapidly weaned off, the fever resolved, the inflammatory syndrome regressed and the patient was discharged 3 weeks after admission in good general condition.

During follow-up, the patient describes a clear improvement in her general condition and dyspnoea, which unfortunately persists on exertion and remains disabling. A follow-up chest CT (figure 4) performed 4 months after hospitalisation showed complete disappearance of pulmonary condensations and ground glass opacities.

### Breast implant adverse events during mammography… [^1137mYEX]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

An FDA study on problems with mammography for women with breast implants was published in the Journal of Women's Health in May, 2004 1. The preliminary results of this study were presented at the FDA Science Forum in April,
2003. The study was a review of adverse event reports from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. Researchers found 66 reports that mentioned problems with mammography for women with breast implants. The majority of problems reported were for breast implant rupture that was suspected to occur during mammography. Rupture during compression for mammography was reported for both silicone gel-filled and saline-filled breast implants.

Other adverse events reported to FDA included implants crushed by mammographic compression, pain during mammography attributed to the implants, inability to perform mammography because of capsular contracture or because of fear of implant rupture, and delayed detection of cancer attributed to the breast implants. It is unknown how often these problems occur because the MAUDE database cannot be used to determine rates of problems occurring. FDA researchers also reviewed published medical literature on mammography for women with breast implants.

Their review found medical reports describing:

- an additional 17 reported cases of breast implant rupture during mammographic compression
- breast implant interference with imaging breast tissue, with between 22% and 83% of mammographically visualizable breast tissue obscured by breast implants
- special techniques needed to maximize breast tissue visualization for women with breast implants
- a delay in breast cancer detection in women with implants, but without increased mortality to women with implants. The risk for breast cancer does not differ in women with breast implants compared to other women. Recommendations for breast cancer screening also apply to women with breast implants. Women considering breast implants should be aware of potential issues with mammography in order to make an informed decision.

Women who already have breast implants should always inform the mammography center that they have breast implants when they make an appointment and always remind the mammography technician that they have breast implants when they go for their exam. 1Brown SL, Ferlo Todd J, Luu H-MD.

British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mammography

If the patient is over 40 years of age, mammography should also be undertaken. Mammography has a low sensitivity and specificity for BIA‐ALCL, but it may be used to assess for any potential mimics/masses and other diagnoses including in situ and invasive primary breast malignancy. In cases of BIA‐ALCL, the capsule may be thickened and the membrane contour may be disrupted. 35

Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging

In cases of diagnostic uncertainty or inconclusive US, MR imaging should be undertaken to assess the implant, effusion, capsule and for any potential mass and local lymphadenopathy. When the diagnosis has been established from the initial US fine‐needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy, MR imaging should be performed to assess disease extent and aid surgical planning. Non‐contrast sequences (T2‐weighted and silicone‐selective) may show implant membrane disruption (rupture), pericapsular effusions and signs of gel bleed (Fig 3C, D). In addition, dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) sequences should be utilised to assess for capsular enhancement (Fig 3E) and masses which may not have been detected on US. 45

FDG PET/CT

2‐[Fluorine‐18]fluoro‐2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) plays an important role in the oncological staging of the majority of subtypes of lymphoma, although BIA‐ALCL was recognised subsequent to the most recent Lugano Classification Guidelines and so the utility of FDG PET/CT in this context has yet to be formally validated. 46 Low cell density peri‐implant effusions may not be FDG‐avid and inflammation/post‐intervention sequalae may lead to non‐malignant FDG uptake hampering interpretation. Nonetheless, expert groups recommend that FDG PET/CT should be undertaken for pre‐operative staging of local extent and distant disease (Fig 4A–C). 26 Carrying out PET/CT prior to the surgical intervention is necessary because post‐surgical inflammation in the chest wall, surrounding breast and regional nodes, may at times persist for a few months and hinder the identification of the uncommon patients that have extracapsular or nodal involvement. PET/CT is also required for response assessment (pre or post‐surgery), where systemic therapy has been administered (Fig 4D–F). 26, 28, 35, 44

### Management of a female with recurrence of fibromatosis of the chest wall adjacent to the breast: a case report [^116CRRBn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
CT and MRI showed a mass on the right inferior chest wall and the general view of the specimen. A: Computed tomography showed a 10×5 cm mass on the right inferior chest wall that appeared to be in continuity with the right pectoralis major muscle and right rectus abdominis muscle. B: Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the breast and the chest confirmed a 9×4 cm mass in close proximity to the lower-inner quadrant of the right breast, with contact to the ribs. C: The surgically removed specimen was lobulated and 14x16x10 cm in size, containing a 10x12x8 cm tumor. D: Bisected tumor showed a grossly circumscribed tumor with white, whorled patterns and without necrosis.

As diagnosis was established, surgery was scheduled. Under general anesthesia with selective intubation, the patient lay on the operating table with supine position. She underwent an en bloc resection of the tumor and the underlying musculature (inferior lateral portion of the right pectoralis major muscle and superior portion of the right rectus abdominis musculature, and anterior portion of the right latissimus dorsi muscle) and en bloc resection of the underlying chest wall structures (seventh rib and intercostal muscle). The defect on the right chest wall was then closed with a 10×10 cm Dacron patch. Although the mass was in close proximity to the lower-inner quadrant of the right breast, all surgical margins were negative with the intraoperative frozen section and the right mastectomy was avoided. Then the right breast was closed in the skin flap plasty. Patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and moved to general care after 24 hours and she was discharged to home after a week. She is currently under follow-up.

### Clinical manifestations and surgical management of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma: beyond the NCCN guidelines [^113EtFhg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is an uncommon peripheral T cell lymphoma arising in response to textured-surface breast implants. Frequently, BIA-ALCL is indolent and typically presents with peri-implant swelling after breast reconstruction or cosmetic augmentation. However, patients can present with an invasive breast or chest wall mass, palpable lymphadenopathy, or metastatic disease. The current literature is limited regarding surgical recommendations for patients with a more aggressive presentation of BIA-ALCL. This report aims to review the various clinical manifestations of BIA-ALCL, including the more advanced and less frequently encountered presentations, with an emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach, with early involvement of a surgical oncologist.

### Plombage rupture presenting as a subcutaneous tumor: unexpected differential diagnosis [^116qWSuF]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 89-year-old woman presented with a swelling on the right side of her décolletage. The swelling was first noticed after physiotherapy treatment for right-sided shoulder pain 3 weeks ago. During physiotherapy, she felt stabbing pain in the right side of her chest when her arm was quickly and vigorously moved to the back. She denied fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

She reported right-sided pulmonary tuberculosis treated with plombage in 1952, a prolapsed disc, and a pheochromocytoma resection 10 years ago.

Physical examination revealed a rubberlike, nontender, 15 × 5-cm, skin-colored lump extending from the right side of the neck to the right shoulder and down toward the middle of the chest (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Ruptured plombage. Large skin-colored lump extending from the right side of the neck to the right shoulder and down toward the middle of the chest.

Because of the clinical aspect of the lump and the age of the patient, a tumor such as sarcoma was taken into consideration. However, lump palpation was unusual and softer than sarcoma and not attached to the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a rupture of the approximately 70-year-old plombage was our most likely diagnosis.

Unexpectedly, the plombage seemed to be intact according to chest radiograph (Fig 2) and magnetic resonance imaging (Fig 3). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass that extended from the upper medial edge of the right scapula to the right axilla along the anterior thoracic wall. The mass surrounded the brachial plexus. Neuroma, sarcoma, lymphoma, and extensive hypertrophic scar after wide plombage thoracoplasty were considered as radiologic differential diagnoses. After a discussion with a pulmonologist and the patient, she accepted a diagnostic biopsy in the surgery department to exclude tumors and ruptured plombage. Despite the magnetic resonance images, the histopathologic examination confirmed the ruptured plombage by detection of foreign-body granulomas and large empty vacuoles, which corresponded to the removed paraffin oil during histologic preparation (Fig 4). Microorganism screening result for tuberculosis was negative.

### Breast reconstruction in a patient with noonan syndrome [^1168hXLa]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern affecting 1 in 1000–2500 births. Patients with this syndrome present with characteristic facial, musculoskeletal, cardiac and endocrine abnormalities. Lack of postpubertal breast development is a common manifestation of this syndrome and may result in severe hypomastia and a masculine appearance of the female chest. We report the first case of breast reconstruction in a 24-year-old woman with NS who lacked postpubertal breast development. Technical considerations for addressing the existing chest wall deformity, implant pocket selection as well as emphasis on the role of the plastic surgeon are presented.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast implant evaluation [^113QXzyp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Breast implant imaging varies depending on patient age, implant type, and symptoms. For asymptomatic patients (any age, any implant), imaging is not recommended. Rupture of saline implants is often clinically evident, as the saline is resorbed and there is a change in breast contour. With saline implants and equivocal clinical findings, ultrasound (US) is the examination of choice for patients less than 30 years of age, either mammography/digital breast tomosynthesis or US may be used for those 30 to 39 years of age, and mammography/digital breast tomosynthesis is used for those 40 years and older. For patients with suspected silicone implant complication, MRI without contrast or US is used for those less than 30 years of age; MRI without contrast, mammography/digital breast tomosynthesis, or US may be used for those 30 to 39 years of age; and MRI without contrast or mammography/digital breast tomosynthesis is used for those 40 years and older. Patients with unexplained axillary adenopathy and silicone implants (current or prior) are evaluated with axillary US. For patients 30 years and older, mammography/digital breast tomosynthesis is performed in conjunction with US. Last, patients with suspected breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma are first evaluated with US, regardless of age or implant type. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Presentation and management of silicone lymphadenopathy: a single institutional retrospective cohort study [^116Jyb4T]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SL is an infrequent phenomenon following implant-based breast surgeries. Frequently identified incidentally, the actual prevalence of SL likely surpasses the reported numbers. There have been a few case reports and case series that have addressed SL. To our knowledge, this is the largest study that reports clinical presentation, imaging findings, and management of SL.

Of the 52 patients with SL in our study, 90.4% underwent implant procedures for breast augmentation, while the remaining 9.6% received implants for reconstructive reasons. The discovery of lymphadenopathy in patients with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer necessitates a thorough assessment for cancer recurrence. In patients who had implant placement for breast augmentation, while malignancy should also be excluded, the presence of SL should be considered. Moreover, patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery often have a lack of breast tissue and may not receive screening mammograms/MRIs as regularly as those who have undergone breast augmentation procedures. This could be why we saw a distinctly higher incidence of cases in cosmetic procedures compared to reconstructive procedures. The median time of detection was 13.5 years for reconstructive procedures and 12.5 for cosmetic procedures which was not significantly different.

Silicone implants have recently become the preferred choice due to the cohesiveness reflecting a trend observed in the industry. As expected, there is a higher incidence of SL with silicone implants. They represent the majority of implants used in both aesthetic and reconstructive surgeries. In the present study, all patients had current or prior silicone implants resulting in SL which is consistent with prior studies. Despite this, it should be recognized that saline implants carry a risk of SL due to their silicone-containing shells which may leak into adjacent tissue, causing the spread of silicone. Therefore, healthcare providers should consider SL as a potential diagnosis when a patient with any type of implant reports lymph node swelling. With either silicone or saline implants, the incidence of implant failure or rupture can be up to 16% within a decade of implant placement. Implant failure has been associated with SL. Most patients in our study also had a current or prior implant rupture. However, SL may be present even in patients with intact breast implants due to silicone leakage from the implant shell. Intact implants were present in 11.3% cases of in our cohort. The rupture can be intracapsular, extracapsular, or a combination of both. However, the type of rupture does not indicate the presence of SL.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^114hJ6LZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Phyllodes tumor recurrence — locally recurrent breast mass following excision of phyllodes tumor: Workup includes history and physical exam, ultrasound, mammogram, tissue sampling (histology preferred), and consider chest imaging (x-ray or CT, CT contrast optional). If there is no metastatic disease, management is re-excision with wide margins without axillary staging and consider post-operative radiation (category 2B). If metastatic disease is present, follow principles of soft-tissue sarcoma (See NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma). For diagnosis, FNA or core biopsy may not distinguish a fibroadenoma from a phyllodes tumor; the sensitivity of core biopsy is greater than that of FNA biopsy, but neither core biopsy nor FNA biopsy can always differentiate phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas, and in cases with clinical suspicion for phyllodes tumor, excision of the lesion may be needed for definitive pathologic classification. There are no prospective randomized data supporting the use of RT for phyllodes tumors; however, in the setting where additional recurrence would create significant morbidity (eg, chest wall recurrence following mastectomy), RT may be considered following the same principles that are applied to the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^113uCjnd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Axillary breast cancer — imaging and immunohistochemical workup: The guidelines suggest the use of a mammogram and breast ultrasound for such patients, and testing for immunohistochemical markers including ER/PR and HER2 is recommended; elevated ER/PR levels provide strong evidence for a breast cancer diagnosis. MRI of the breast should be considered for a patient with histopathologic evidence of breast cancer when mammography and ultrasound are not adequate to assess the extent of the disease, may be especially helpful in patients with dense breast tissue, positive axillary nodes, and suspected occult primary breast tumor or to evaluate the chest wall, and has been shown to be useful in identifying the primary site and may also facilitate breast conservation by allowing for lumpectomy instead of mastectomy. The NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary also provide recommendations for additional workup, including chest and abdominal CT to evaluate for evidence of distant metastases for adenocarcinoma of the axillary nodes without evidence of a primary breast lesion; in particular, breast MRI and ultrasound are recommended and axillary ultrasound should also be performed.

### Axillary lipogranuloma mimicking carcinoma metastasis after silicone breast implant rupture: a case report [^113y97j6]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Silicone-gel-filled breast implants have been widely used for breast augmentation and reconstruction after mastectomy. However, silicone implants have some well-known complications, such as implant rupture, which requires surgical intervention. Dissemination of silicone particles out of the implant causes a granulomatous reaction, a phenomenon known as silicone granuloma, in breast parenchyma as well as axillary, breast and chest wall lymph nodes, which mimics breast cancer metastasis. However, lipogranuloma after silicone breast implant rupture has not been reported in the literature, although it is a common complication after mineral oil or liquid silicone injection. We present a case report of an axillary lymphadenopathy resulting from lipogranuloma after silicone-gel-filled implant rupture. Review of the literature suggests that this is the first report of a lipogranuloma resulting from implant rupture.

### What are the acute… [^117TN1oL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY Capsular contracture is the most commonly reported complication following breast implant surgery and refers to thickening and calcification of scar tissue around the implant. Implant rupture occurs when a loss of integrity of the outer shell occurs, causing the contents to leak into the surrounding tissue. Ruptured implants necessitate a surgical referral for removal or replacement, but implant removal is not emergent and can take place on an elective basis. When saline implants rupture, the fluid is absorbed by the body, and the implant collapses with notable change in the size of the breast. 19 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that patients with silicone breast implants undergo routine screening for implant rupture with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography five to six years postoperatively and then every two to three years thereafter.

20 Importantly, the recommendations for MRI are meant to proactively identify implant rupture. There is no role for MRI in the detection or secondary prevention of breast implant–associated ALCL. 21 Reasons for explantation varied; approximately one-half of saline and smooth gel implants were removed because of implant performance failures such as rupture, capsular contracture, pain, malrotation, and rippling. For implants removed secondary to rupture, the mean time to rupture was 8. 4 years and
8. 1 years for saline and smooth gel implants, respectively. Breast implant–associated ALCL is initially diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and/or physical examination. Patients most commonly present with a peri-implant effusion. What Are Breast Cancer Screening Considerations for Patients with Breast Implants. EVIDENCE SUMMARY In addition to routine mammography views, additional displacement views described by Eklund in the 1980s remain the standard of care for breast implants.

38 Despite these additional views, obscuration of breast tissue caused by the radiopaque implant may decrease mammographic sensitivity because breast tissue closer to the chest wall is more difficult to visualize with a breast implant in place. 39 Importantly, routine screening mammography is recommended based on age and personal risk factors for patients, despite the presence of an implant. MRIs for implant rupture surveillance do not replace mammographic screening. EVIDENCE SUMMARY A prospective multicenter cohort study found that for patients undergoing implant-based reconstruction after mastectomy, infections may present late. 45 Radiation therapy and increased body mass index were identified as risk factors for late surgical-site infection in this group.

### Breast cancer in a patient with birt-hogg-dubésyndrome (BHDS) with dramatic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^114LXoe3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

This is a case of 49-year-old white woman who presented with a rapidly growing right sided breast mass. A subsequent punch biopsy confirmed grade 3 invasive mammary carcinoma of no special type which was negative for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2 neu overexpression. She was a carrier of folliculin gene mutation that is characteristic of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS), a condition known to cause skin lesions, renal cancers and pneumothoraces. Family history revealed patient's mother, grandmother and maternal aunt developed renal cell carcinomas during their lifetime and were positive for the same germ line mutation. Tumour tissue was positive for TP53 mutation and negative for BRCA1, BRCA2 and other genes commonly associated with breast cancer. We report a patient with BHDS presenting with breast cancer that showed dramatic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to bilateral mastectomy, local chest wall radiation and 6 months of adjuvant capecitabine.

### Breast lesions on chest computed tomography: pictorial review with mammography and ultrasound correlation [^115cxLhD]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This pictorial review demonstrates computed tomography (CT) features with mammogram and, in some instances, ultrasound and positron emission tomography scan correlation of a wide spectrum of both malignant and benign findings on breast evaluation. Characterization of the margins, shape, pattern of enhancement, density, and associated findings is essential for accurate assessment of breast lesions during CT examination. Spiculated margins, irregular shape, and the presence of enhancement have a high predictive pattern for malignancy. The associated findings that could be seen include skin thickening, lymphadenopathy, architectural distortion, or chest wall or skin invasion. Nearly all detected breast calcifications on chest CT scans are benign. However, any breast masses and calcifications seen need further evaluation by other modalities, such as mammography or ultrasound or both.

### Unnecessary explantation of IDEAL IMPLANT structured saline breast implants prompted byRadiologic misdiagnosis of rupture [^114amvV5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The unique dual-lumen and baffle design of the IDEAL IMPLANT Structured Saline breast implant gives it specific advantages over both silicone gel-filled and the original saline-filled implants. This internal baffle structure also gives it an appearance on various radiologic imaging studies that may be misinterpreted as a rupture because of similarities to the well-known radiologic appearance of a ruptured silicone gel implant. Patients may present with various misinterpreted imaging studies, highlighting the need for plastic surgeons and radiologists to be familiar with the normal appearance of the intact IDEAL IMPLANT and be able to distinguish it from a ruptured IDEAL IMPLANT. The radiology findings must be correlated with the clinical findings, or an intact IDEAL IMPLANT misdiagnosed as ruptured, may cause unnecessary patient worry, and may prompt unnecessary surgery for removal or replacement.

### Radiation-induced dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma of the chest wall [^112GqvgZ]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Description

A 46-year-old woman presented with a fixed mass on the lateral part of her right chest wall between the third and fifth ribs, a hands-breadth anterior to the anterior margin of the latissimus dorsi muscle and at the site of a previous surgical scar. She had a 4-year history of wide local excision of a 10-mm diameter invasive, triple-negative grade 3 ductal carcinoma of the right breast with 2 of 10 lymph nodes involved. Following surgery, she received adjuvant radiotherapy to the resected area and continued with adjuvant chemotherapy.

A computed tomography scan confirmed a large 7 × 5 cm mass in the outer lower quadrant of the right breast, in keeping with recurrence of breast carcinoma. There was superficial muscle and chest wall invasion into intercostal muscles but no deep invasion through the chest wall. On positron emission tomography scan, the mass was intensely avid (standardized uptake value max of 12.0) with a necrotic center, and fluorideoxyglucose uptake was confined to its periphery. The mass was closely related to the underlying anterior end of the right fourth rib, with no uptake within the rib to suggest bony involvement and no regional, lung, or distant metastases.

Core biopsies obtained were initially determined to be of a metaplastic triple-negative breast carcinoma. The possibility of sarcoma was considered. However, a second opinion from the sarcoma multidisciplinary team could not truly confirm a sarcoma. Hence, further core biopsies were obtained, which again suggested triple-negative metaplastic breast carcinoma. Radiotherapy was considered unsuitable, because the patient had received previous radiotherapy to the area. She was referred for surgical resection of the recurrence. To prevent any future recurrence, a deep margin comprising resection of ribs 3 to 5 was considered essential.

For surgical resection and reconstruction of the chest wall defect, 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology, as previously described by Goldsmith-Bragg, was used to plan the surgical resection and fabricate the anatomic, custom-made replacement titanium rib implants(Figure 1).

### Atypical deep somatic soft-tissue leiomyoma of extrathoracic chest wall: first case of the literature [^113xPG3C]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas are benign soft-tissue tumours which take origin from the smooth muscles. Pleura and chest wall are uncommon location for such tumours. Here, we report a case of a 26-year-old female patient presented with 3 months history of chest pain. Chest X-ray and CT showed a calcified mass of 6×12cm in size in the left lateral of the chest wall. After resection of the mass, pathological examination diagnosed it as atypical deep somatic soft-tissue leiomyoma of extrathoracic chest wall. No pathological finding was detected during follow-up.

### Retained surgical swab following breast augmentation: a rare cause of a breast mass [^111vY4hT]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Retained surgical swab or sponge following surgery is an uncommon finding seen most commonly following abdominal and pelvic procedures. Reports of such lesions in the breast are particularly rare with only two previously published cases. We report here the first case of a retained swab following breast augmentation where unique diagnostic problems are encountered because of the presence of implants. This case shows that a retained swab should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any postoperative breast mass and highlights that ignoring the fundamental principles of any surgical procedure can cause serious complications.

A rare but important constellation of musculoskeletal and cutaneous symptoms, including synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis, has recently been designated the SAPHO syndrome. The exact etiology is unknown, although various infectious agents have been proposed. The most common site of osteoarticular involvement is the sternoclavicular joint, and therefore, recognition of this syndrome and appropriate workup and management is crucial in the differential diagnosis of an anterior chest wall mass.

### Migration of breast augmentation filler to the mediastinum mimicking lymphoma: a case report [^114SwD6Y]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Subcutaneously injected breast augmentation filler is gaining popularity as a cosmetic procedure. Unlike silicone implants, subcutaneously injected fillers have no barrier to contain the shape and stop migration. There are case reports of filler material migrating to the inguinal area, axilla, chest wall, abdominal wall, and peritoneum. There has been one reported case of early migration of breast filler to the mediastinum — the material used as a breast filler was liquid silicone oil, and was discovered in the mediastinum 10 days after injection into bilateral breasts. This could have been due to direct instillation into the mediastinum during the procedure itself, or migration through a surgically created tract during the procedure. We report the first case of delayed breast filler migration to the mediastinum.

This phenomenon is important for clinicians to note because it resembles lymphoma on a computed tomography scan of the chest. In the case of our patient, she was counseled to have a working diagnosis of lymphoma, which caused much anxiety. The radiologists we consulted were also concerned about lymphoma. After the patient sought a consultation at a second hospital, magnetic resonance imaging of the breast showed that her breast filler material had likely leaked into the mediastinum. The "enlarged lymph nodes" in the mediastinum were also of the same signal intensity as the filler material found in the breast. Surgical evacuation of the mediastinal collection confirmed the mediastinal collection to be breast filler material.

We hope our clinical encounter can benefit other patients who are considering breast augmentation options, as well as clinicians who may see "mediastinal masses" in patients with a history of breast augmentation fillers.

### Diagnostic and screening magnetic resonance imaging of the breast [^114ksVzQ]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Breast MRI for suspected implant rupture — For evaluation of suspected breast implant rupture, especially in patients with silicone implants, evaluation is indicated when MRI findings will aid the decision-making for implant removal or aid the diagnostic evaluation of indeterminate clinical or conventional imaging findings in patients with implants. The MRI protocol for detection of silicone leak is different from the protocol for detection of breast cancer, so it is important to clearly define the purpose of the breast MRI if the concern is a silicone leak.

### Surgical treatment for postpneumonectomy syndrome [^113wkD2N]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights the significant challenges posed by PPS, a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of pneumonectomy. Mediastinal repositioning with prosthetic implantation has been reported as an effective intervention for PPS in select cases. By restoring the anatomical alignment of the mediastinum, the procedure alleviates tracheal and bronchial compression, improving respiratory function. In this case, the insertion of two silicone prostheses in the pneumonectomy cavity successfully stabilised the mediastinum, reducing airway malacia and minimising the risk of recurrent obstruction. We used the anatomical-shaped breast implants because of experience using those in Birmingham (MK).

This case is particularly noteworthy as it demonstrates that a surgical centre without prior experience in similar procedures can achieve satisfactory outcomes in the management of complex conditions such as PPS.

Additionally, we have presented a feasible method and recipe for treating PPS. Our approach aligns well with previously reported treatment modalities and supports the feasibility of adopting advanced techniques even in settings with limited prior experience.

A recent systematic review conducted in 2023 evaluated optimal management strategies for PPS including 104 patients across 41 studies. Treatment approaches were categorised into three distinct groups: (1) mediastinal repositioning using a tissue expander or fixed-volume prosthesis, (2) stenting and (3) alternative methods, including mediastinal repositioning without the use of tissue fillers.

The findings of the systematic review indicated that mediastinal repositioning employing a tissue expander or fixed-volume prosthesis was the most effective approach, achieving a significantly lower overall mortality rate of 4.8%, compared with 66.7% observed in the stenting group. Furthermore, it was noted that all patients who underwent mediastinal repositioning without tissue fillers eventually required at least one additional procedure, emphasising the importance of adequate mediastinal support. In this case, fixed-volume expanders were used. The patient experiences mild wheezing when coughing, which might have been improved by using tissue expanders, allowing for postoperative adjustments through the addition or removal of saline from the implants.

In our case, we employed mediastinal repositioning with a fixed-volume prosthesis, which was performed successfully. This outcome further supports the efficacy and safety of this approach, even in centres with limited prior experience in managing PPS.

Learning points

Postpneumonectomy syndrome (PPS) should be considered a rare differential diagnosis in patients presenting with respiratory distress following pneumonectomy.
Surgical management of PPS involving mediastinal repositioning with a tissue filler has been associated with the lowest overall mortality among treatment options.
Mediastinal repositioning with a tissue filler was successfully performed at a cardiothoracic centre with no prior experience in the surgical management of PPS.

### Anaplastic large cell lymphoma occurring in women with breast implants: analysis of 173 cases [^114axejB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The first silicone breast implant was inserted in 1962. In 1997, the first case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in association with a silicone breast implant was reported. The authors reviewed 37 articles in the world literature reporting on 79 patients and collected another 94 unreported cases as of the date of submission.

Methods

The world literature was reviewed. Missing clinical and laboratory information was solicited from the authors and treating physicians. As several different specialties were involved, information was not in one place. Many (but not all) authors and treating physicians were responsive, resulting in incomplete data.

Results

ALCL lesions first presented as late peri-implant seromas, a mass attached to the capsule, tumor erosion through the skin, in a regional node, or discovered during revision surgery. The clinical course varied widely from a single positive cytology result followed by apparent spontaneous resolution, to disseminated treatment-resistant tumor and death. There was no preference for saline or silicone fill or for cosmetic or reconstructive indications. Where implant history was known, the patient had received at least one textured-surface device. Extracapsular dissemination occurred in 18 cases; nine of those were fatal. Histochemical markers were primarily CD-30 and Alk-1. Other markers occurred at a lower frequency. Risk estimates ranged from one in 500,000 to one in 3 million women with implants.

Conclusion

Breast implant-associated ALCL is a novel manifestation of site- and material-specific lymphoma originating in a specific scar location, presenting a wide array of diverse characteristics and suggesting a multifactorial cause.

### Silicone gel breast implant rupture presenting as a fluctuant back mass after latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction [^112bdDBv]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The authors describe a patient who presented with acute onset of a lower back fluctuant mass 12 years after breast reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap and silicone gel implant. Aspiration and subsequent surgical exploration revealed this mass to be free-flowing silicone gel within a cavity that was confluent with the breast implant capsule through an axillary tunnel. Excision of the back cavity, explantation with subtotal capsulectomy, and implant replacement resolved the problem. Although distant migration of extracapsular silicone gel from the breast to the axilla, arm, abdomen, and groin has been described, the authors think this represents the first reported case of distant migration of silicone gel to the lower back.

Imaging modality notes in adults with a neck mass — The performance of chest x-ray in the setting of a neck mass has not been established, although if the patient is deemed at risk for a primary lung cancer the results of a chest x-ray can guide further testing and management. PET/CT is ideally reserved for those patients in whom malignancy was already diagnosed and is generally utilized as part of the staging process.

### Breast implant foreign body reaction mimicking breast cancer recurrence on FDG PET / CT [^114SAh9u]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A woman with bilateral breast cancer treated with bilateral mastectomies, implant reconstructions, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy underwent FDG PET/CT imaging. Imaging demonstrated sternal, nodal, and lung lesions which were stable or slowly increasing, as well as a parasternal chest wall mass which was enlarging much more rapidly and was excised. Pathology of the chest wall mass demonstrated only benign soft tissue with fat necrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction, without evidence of malignancy or implant rupture. This case demonstrates how a benign FDG-avid foreign body reaction, induced by an intact breast prosthesis, could easily be mistaken for malignancy.

### Inflammatory state after intrathoracic breast implant placement for postpneumonectomy syndrome [^116cX9Ng]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of a 16-year-old patient who underwent right pneumonectomy for pulmonary vein atresia and developed postpneumonectomy syndrome. She had an 800 cm³ saline-filled silicone tissue expander placed in the right hemithorax with resolution of her postpneumonectomy syndrome. However, 2 years later, she developed fevers, night sweats, and arthralgias. Her medical workup was negative for vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious etiologies. She underwent tissue expander removal, resulting in resolution of her symptoms. This report describes a case of an inflammatory state created by a tissue expander placed for postpneumonectomy syndrome.

Silicon granuloma is one of the benign complications of breast implant failure but this is rarely reported. We report a 66-year-old lady presented to respiratory department with history of weight loss and a chest x-ray was highly suggestive of a lung malignancy. Further investigation including CT thorax and breast ultrasound suggested siliconoma that was later on confirmed on tissue biopsy.

### Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions [^115Qok58]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Exclusions and patient factors — MIBT limitations are described, noting justifiable reasons why the diagnosis of a breast abnormality cannot be made by MIBT, including lesions that cannot be accurately targeted by image guidance and some lesions immediately juxtaposed to an implant, chest wall, or skin. Multiple patient factors may preclude MIBT, including inability to lie prone for stereotactic or MRI-guided MIBT, mental disability that limits patient cooperation, and body habitus, such as extreme kyphosis or obesity. It is unclear how to manage patients who receive antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment and are referred for MIBT; the risk of the patient bleeding from MIBT must be balanced against the risk of anticoagulation cessation before the procedure, and this decision may require consultation with the patient's prescribing clinician. Patient preference of biopsy technique or lack of access to imaging-guided biopsy equipment may not allow MIBT, and the ASBrS supports patient shared decision-making regarding MIBT.

Implant Rupture

Rupture of the implant generally occurs in less than 1% of cases. The rupture can be intra- or extracapsular (Fig. 13 a and b). It can be caused by various factors including defects in the manufacture of the implant or deterioration, the passing of time, the shell of the implant, trauma, or an unnoticed rupture during surgery.

Fig. 13
a Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of intracapsular rupture (Linguine sign). b An MRI of extracapsular rupture

Rupture of the implant is associated with the breast's loss of shape. Physical examination can determine the diagnosis. The breast can be touched when it is extracapsular but not when it is intracapsular. However, because a margin of error is always possible, the diagnosis should be corroborated by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study.

When cohesive silicone implants rupture, the principal symptoms are contour irregularity and a palpable mass attributable to the capsular contracture. The symptoms of a ruptured saline implant are deformity of the contour and an abrupt collapse. With the rupture of liquid silicone gel implants, the symptoms are deformity of the contour, redness, and pain.

Inflatable saline implants can become deflated due to valve failure or leakage through folds, which happens when the implant becomes folded at some point, thus producing friction between the edges of the folds until the shell is ruptured. Should this occur, the implant must be extracted and the pocket cleaned, followed by the fitting of a new cohesive gel implant.

### Diagnostic and imaging approaches to chest wall lesions [^1173Lffg]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chest wall lesions are relatively uncommon and may be challenging once they are encountered on images. Radiologists may detect these lesions incidentally at examinations performed for other indications, or they may be asked specifically to evaluate a suspicious lesion. While many chest wall lesions have characteristic imaging findings that can result in an accurate diagnosis with use of imaging alone, other entities are difficult to distinguish at imaging because there is significant overlap among them. The interpreting radiologist should be familiar with the imaging features of both "do not touch" benign entities (which can be confidently diagnosed with imaging only, with no need for biopsy or resection unless the patient is symptomatic) and lesions that cannot be confidently characterized and thus require further workup. CT and MRI are the main imaging modalities used to assess the chest wall, with each having different benefits and drawbacks. Chest wall lesions can be classified according to their predominant composition: fat, calcification and ossification, soft tissue, or fluid. The identification or predominance of signal intensities or attenuation for these findings, along with the patient age, clinical history, and lesion location, can help establish the appropriate differential diagnosis. In addition, imaging findings in other organs, such as the lungs or upper abdomen, can at times provide clues to the underlying diagnosis. The authors review different chest wall lesions classified on the basis of their composition and highlight the imaging findings that can assist the radiologist in narrowing the differential diagnosis and guiding management. © RSNA, 2022.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^116k5NjQ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

One single-institution, 20-year retrospective review of locoregional recurrences, secondary cancers, and atypical breast neoplasms after autologous breast reconstruction found a local recurrence rate of 5.3%. Another institution conducted a 10-year retrospective review of patients undergoing immediate autologous free flap reconstruction and found a locoregional recurrence rate of 3.25%. This is comparable with the < 10% locoregional recurrence rate reported in the literature. Yang et al. conducted a meta-analysis comparing the prognosis of breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy alone and those who underwent mastectomy followed by immediate breast reconstruction, and found no increased risk of recurrence of breast cancer and no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival, with some studies finding that immediate breast reconstruction was associated with improved prognosis. Bargon et al. evaluated locoregional recurrence in patients undergoing immediate and delayed autologous postmastectomy breast reconstruction and found no difference in recurrence rates.

Locoregional recurrences are more likely to occur in the skin or subcutaneous tissue, and as such are most often detected by physical examination by either the patient or the clinician, with patients commonly reporting symptoms such as palpable masses, tissue irregularity, skin changes, pain, or tenderness. – However, in cases where locoregional recurrence is located in the chest wall or deep in the reconstructed breast, detection can be more challenging. In recent years, there has been a shift towards prepectoral implant-based reconstruction, whereas implants were previously placed below the pectoralis muscle, so either the chest wall or subcutaneous recurrences would be superficial to the reconstruction. As more patients undergo prepectoral reconstruction, chest wall recurrences deep to the implant may be more difficult to detect. Locoregional recurrence is associated with a poor prognosis, with 61% survival at 80 months for skin or subcutaneous tissue recurrences, and 45% survival at 80 months for chest wall recurrence. Shammas et al. found that post-reconstruction imaging was not a predictor of overall survival, with no statistically significant difference in the 5-year survival rate of patients who underwent routine surveillance imaging, imaging for a palpable mass, or no imaging in the postoperative period.

Distribution of implant placement etiology

Clinical presentation and imaging characteristics for patients with SL are presented in Table 2. While most patients presented with unilateral SL (71.1%, n = 37), 28.9% (n = 15) of patients had bilateral SL. Most patients, 96.2% (n = 50), had silicone implants in place at the time of SL diagnosis, while 3.8% (n = 2) had saline implants and had a history of prior silicone implants. Most patients (69.3%, n = 36) were asymptomatic (Fig. 2), while non-tender lymphadenopathy was reported in 7.7% (n = 4), painful lymphadenopathy in 19.2% (n = 10), and mixed non-tender and painful lymphadenopathy in 1.9% (n = 1). None of the patients had capsular contracture, breast asymmetry, respiratory symptoms, or pericarditis. Systemic symptoms including fever, chills, weight loss, generalized weakness, and fatigue were only noted in one patient. Implant rupture was evident in 88.7% (n = 46) of patients; 13.0% (n = 6) intracapsular, 26.1% (n = 12) extracapsular, and 15.2% (n = 7) both intra- and extra-capsular. The type of rupture was unknown in 45.7% (n = 21) of cases (Fig. 3). Of patients with documented implant rupture, 34.6% (n = 18) had a rupture of the current implant and 53.9% (n = 28) had a rupture of a prior implant which was subsequently removed/exchanged. Of the 11.5% (n = 6) patients that did not have an implant rupture, the capsules were noted to be intact in all 6. Lymph node region involvement was predominantly in the axilla at 86.5% (n = 45), with 3.9% (n = 2) in the internal mammary and 9.6% (n = 5) involving more than one region. SL was detected by ultrasonography (USG) in 80.7% (n = 42), mammography (MMG) in 67.3% (n = 35), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 17.3% (n = 9), and computed tomography (CT) in 3.8% (n = 2) of cases. Multiple imaging modalities were employed in 42.3% (n = 22) of cases.

### Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions [^1178dLr9]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Image-guided percutaneous biopsy of palpable and nonpalpable breast lesions — exclusions and patient-related limitations are detailed as follows: Lesions that cannot be accurately targeted by image guidance and some lesions immediately juxtaposed to an implant, chest wall, or skin may not be amenable to MIBT. There are patient factors that may preclude MIBT, including inability to lie prone for stereotactic or MRI-guided MIBT, mental disability that limits patient cooperation, and body habitus, such as extreme kyphosis or obesity. It is prudent to manage patients who receive antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment and are referred for MIBT, and the risk of the patient bleeding from MIBT must be balanced against the risk of anticoagulation cessation before the procedure; this decision may require consultation with the patient's prescribing care provider. Patient preference of biopsy technique or lack of access to imaging-guided biopsy equipment may not allow MIBT.

### How to respond to the US food and drug administration's report on squamous cell carcinoma in breast implant capsules [^111HSLkx]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Unlike promptly diagnosed and treated cases of breast implant–associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), SCC of the breast implant capsule is highly aggressive and despite early intervention has nearly a 50% 6-month mortality rate. It is critical that future cases of SCC promptly be reported to the implant manufacturer and the FDA at.

Although not forewarned of either announcement, The Aesthetic Society promptly informed its members how breast implant–associated SCC should be diagnosed and treated, as well as how it could be discussed with patients. Presentation most often is sternal/chest pain, but also mass, seroma, swelling, erythema, and capsular contracture. Work-up involves an ultrasound to evaluate for periprosthetic fluid; aspiration of any such fluid, and in addition to tests to rule out BIA-ALCL, analysis of fluid for CK 5/6, p63, and flow cytometry for squamous cells and keratin. If positive, an MRI can be done both with and without contrast to evaluate for a mass, and a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan can be ordered to ascertain the extent of the disease. Treatment consists of en bloc capsulectomy and complete resection of the tumor, which often extends beyond the capsule at the time of diagnosis. (Although there appears to be no role for an en bloc capsulectomy in the treatment of "breast implant illness", it is an important part of an operation for a malignancy such as SCC.) Chemotherapy and radiation seem ineffective. These can be very problematic cases and probably should be treated at major institutions prepared for what can be major resections of the chest wall and aggressive disease progression.

### Iatrogenic intrathoracic encapsulated siliconoma from a ruptured breast implant [^112c1PHi]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Our patient was a 57-year-old woman with a history of bilateral retropectoral silicone breast augmentation and axillary hyperhidrosis who underwent a bilateral thoracic sympathectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery by a surgeon at an outside hospital approximately 20 years ago. The left side required an open thoracotomy. Shortly after the surgery, she developed a left-sided Baker 4 capsular contracture and the left implant was noted to be ruptured. Both implants were exchanged. Several years later the patient began to experience progressive fatigue. Work-up revealed a left lung nodule and she underwent a biopsy that confirmed silicone granulomas. It was hypothesised that at the time of her initial thoracotomy the implant was violated resulting in silicone spillage into the thoracic cavity. The patient was referred to our institution for advanced management of her intrathoracic silicosis. The patient underwent bilateral removal of her silicone implants, total capsulectomy and needle-localised removal of her left thoracic silicone masses. She had an uneventful postoperative course with resolution of her fatigue.

### Silicone thorax due to a ruptured breast implant [^115jeSwU]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

A woman with a history of bilateral mastectomy and silicone implants for fibrocystic disease and a history of atrial septal defect repair presented with pleural nodules on a chest radiograph. A thorascopic biopsy performed for possible mesothelioma demonstrated chronic inflammation and focal pleural fibrosis due to a foreign-body reaction secondary to silicone. This was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive radiograph elemental analysis. As the population ages, the increasing frequency of ruptured silicone implants and the need for heart surgery may result in a corresponding increase in the risk for fibrothorax secondary to inadvertent silicone introduction during surgery.

### Evaluating breast implant screening guidelines in breast cancer reconstruction [^115aT9UT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration updated its surveillance recommendations for breast implant rupture to ultrasound screening or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 5–6 years following silicone implant placement, with repeat screening every 2–3 years thereafter. This study evaluates the risk of implant rupture and assesses the utility of routine surveillance MRIs in diagnosing implant rupture.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients with implant-based reconstruction for breast cancer with a single surgeon between 2012 and 2017. Inclusion criteria included a 5-year minimum follow-up period. Analysis was performed to elucidate rupture rate and associated factors.

Results

A total of 376 patients underwent reconstruction with saline (13%) and silicone implants (87%). Seventy-five (20%) underwent routine MRI screening within 5–6 years of surgery. Implant rupture occurred in 26 patients (7%). Average time from implant placement to rupture was 5.9 ± 4.0 years. Fifty-nine percent of silicone implant ruptures were diagnosed by MRI screening. Thirty-eight percent of silicone implant ruptures presented without clinical symptoms and were identified on routine MRI screening. All saline implant ruptures presented with clinical symptoms. On imaging, ruptures were classified as intracapsular (81%) or extracapsular (12%). Seventy-three percent of ruptures were confirmed intraoperatively during implant replacement. Median time for rupture diagnosis to implant removal/replacement was 3 months (range, 0.5–21 months).

Conclusions

MRI screening for silicone implant rupture in implant-based breast reconstruction had a 59% detection rate, with relatively low patient adherence (20% within 5–6 years after surgery), highlighting the challenges of screening. Patients should be counseled on the risk of implant rupture and the likelihood of needing replacement during their lifetime.

### Systemic siliconomas following breast implant rupture [^112doqu4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We report a case of a woman in her late 40s with a history of breast implant surgery following breast cancer treatment. She presented with asymmetrical breast enlargement, palpable contralateral axillary lymph nodes and cutaneous nodules on both forearms. In addition, imaging evaluation revealed intracapsular implant rupture, ipsilateral internal mammary enlarged lymph nodes and multiple mediastinal lymphadenopathies. Skin and axillary lymph node biopsy demonstrated a chronic granulomatous reaction with foreign-body giant cells related to silicone. Following surgical removal of the breast implant, cutaneous nodules disappeared, and all lymph nodes decreased in size. Systemic deposition of silicone in the form of foreign-body granulomas, also known as siliconomas, is a rare complication of breast implant rupture, which is thought to result from silicone lymphatic or hematogenous migration. In the setting of breast cancer, excluding recurrence should be a priority. While there is no standardised therapeutic approach, implant removal can be an option.

### Desmoid tumour of the breast [^111dzRLX]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Desmoid tumour of the breast is a rare fibroblastic tumour whose spectrum ranges from being locally inert to aggressive and destructive, and represents 0.2% of all breast tumours. A 22-year-old woman, 2 years post-cosmetic augmentation mammoplasty with silicone implants, presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging mass in her left breast. Ultrasound showed a well-defined, hypoechoic mass arising within the muscles of the anterior chest, deep beneath the implant and not involving the underlying rib. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) showed features in keeping with changes associated with silicone implants. A provisional diagnosis of scarring and fibroblastic proliferation was made. The lesion was excised and the implant, noted to be intact, was exchanged. Immunochemistry showed strong positivity for vimentin and variable positivity for SMA and desmin, and patchy positivity for beta catenin. A final diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis was made. Although the association of desmoid tumour and breast implants has been described, this case is unique as the FNA was highly suggestive of a silicone granuloma and the diagnosis of desmoid tumour was made on definitive pathology. The aetiology of desmoid tumours is reviewed and current treatment modalities discussed.

### Radiology of chest wall masses [^1124NqLt]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to highlight the role of radiography, CT, PET/CT, and MRI in the diagnosis and management of chest wall lesions. Chest wall masses are caused by a spectrum of clinical entities. The lesions highlighted in this selection of case scenarios include neoplastic, inflammatory, and vascular lesions.

Conclusion

Imaging evaluation with radiography, CT, MRI, and PET/CT plays an important role in the accurate diagnosis of chest wall lesions. It can also facilitate percutaneous biopsy, when it is indicated. Imaging enables accurate staging and is a key component of treatment planning for chest wall masses.

### Management of a late breast implant rupture in the setting of previous radiation [^114jtPsW]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of ruptured breast implants is scarcely discussed in the literature, especially in the setting of previous breast cancer and radiation. The authors present an uncommon presentation of late breast implant rupture with seroma and history of prior radiation. It is important to acknowledge the increased risk of wound healing complications in patients who are several years' postradiation therapy for breast cancer and should be an important factor when discussing treatment options with the patient.

### Chest wall sarcoma: 18F-FDG PET / CT in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^114QjLSJ]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder also known as the SBLA cancer syndrome (sarcoma, breast, leukemia, and adrenal). A 39-year-old female patient with a history of bilateral breast cancer treated with bilateral mastectomies and radiation treatment 4 years ago and left chest wall pleomorphic sarcoma 1 year ago presented with a small hypermetabolic right chest wall mass on 18F-FDG PET/CT. This mass was found to be a spindle cell sarcoma. FDG PET/CT plays an important role in following up oncology patients, particularly in group of high-risk malignancy, for detecting small hypermetabolic lesions.

### Invasive stage III breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma successfully treated with incomplete resection [^112Fm13j]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman with history of bilateral breast augmentation 15 years prior presented with right breast swelling, peri-implant effusion and a palpable inferomedial mass. Effusion aspiration demonstrated pleiomorphic cells consistent with breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Further diagnostic studies confirmed stage III disease with a 4.7cm right breast mass and fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in an internal mammary chain lymph node. The patient underwent surgery with incomplete resection due to invasion of the chest wall followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. BIA-ALCL typically presents as an indolent effusion, however advanced disease carries a worse prognosis. This case highlights successful treatment without recurrence past the one-year mark as well as the need for multidisciplinary management when dealing with advanced disease.

### Breast autoinflation with sterile pus as a marker of implant rupture: single-stage treatment and outcome for five consecutive cases [^113vJKTL]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Augmentation mammaplasty is one of the most common aesthetic procedures performed. Early complications of the procedure are hematoma and infection, and late complications include capsular contracture and device failure or its displacement. Failure of saline implants is readily identifiable, whereas rupture of silicon gel implants can occur without symptoms due to lack of volume loss. Autoinflation of the breast caused by intracapsular and intraprosthetic collection of sterile pus has been reported. A series of five consecutive breast autoinflations with sterile pus is presented. All the patients presented with acute swelling of the breast 2–10 years after prostheses implantation. Intracapsular sterile pus with macroscopic shell tear was seen in four cases. In the remaining case, an intracapsular and intraprosthetic collection of sterile pus with a tear in an otherwise intact implant was seen under the microscope. All five cases showed no microbial growth on culture or sensitivity, and all were treated using a single-stage procedure. The follow-up periods ranged from 8 weeks to 1 year without recurrence of symptoms.
